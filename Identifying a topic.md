Week 3: Identifying a topic 

**Topic 1:  Pirate Radio, Internet Radio**

I am interested in the medium of pirate radio broadcasting historically and today ------ and I'm also interested in how internet radio stations function today, alongside the streaming service giants and playlisting/radio features that they offer. 

Research question 1: 

I am interested in the history of pirate radio broadcasting practices because I want to know more about the connections of these stations to current independent web radio stations 

    [ in order to better understand station proliferation, operational practices, broadcast range, listenership (demographics, interests, etc)

Research question 2: 

I am interested in the current practices of pirate radio utilizing 'traditional' broadcast am/fm signals because I want to know about how internet radio functions vs "terrestrial broadcast" methods 

	[in order to visualize the constraints for each medium, or map proliferation of each --- or determine areas served]	

Research question 3:  

I am interested in the current practices of internet radio stations vs 24/7 livestreams on youtube (or other streaming sites) because I want to know more about the populations served by each in order to determine which format serves a broader listenership

Research question 4: 

I am interested in the state of play between internet radio stations and streaming service playlist algorithms because I want to know if the human selection decisions of one influence the algorithmic decisions of the other, in order to determine the success of each platform in relation to the satisfaction of the user.

Research question 5: 

I am interested in mapping internet radio stations in terms of popularity and genre (and other characteristics) because I want to know more about this platform and its use today in order to provide a practical tool to a broad audience of potential listeners.

CONCERNS:



*   How to find the data?  Will there be enough to create a meaningful visualization?
*   Troubled that I can't 

**Topic 2: Music in Public Space**

I am interested in how music functions in terms of public space (lobbies, elevators, restaurants, wherever music happens without the person hearing it making any decisions about what they want to hear, or if they want to hear anything at all.) How are these selection choices made and what data are they based on? I know that 'audio consulting' is a business (and probably a secretive one) but I would love to know how these playlists are created and the processes that go into creating them. Would someone allow me access to view into this process or would it be too risky of tradecraft / stealing secrets? 

Research question 1: 

I am interested in studying the use of music in public spaces because I want to know more about the patterns that might emerge in the use of music and how the choices reflect or present the space it's contained within, in order to broaden my reader's perspective and awareness of their surroundings.

Research question 2:  

I am interested in the industry of audio consultation because I want to know if it's possible to study this field as a researcher without connections to the industry in order to determine how secret/available the data is and what it could be used to represent (visually)

Research question 3:  

I am interested in exploring song-tagging data (per a service like Shazam, or Gracenote, or potentially ASCAP or BMI?) because I want to know more about patterns based on location / genre / time / and other characteristics in order to determine how these services are being used and which artists/platforms are most successful. 

Research question 4: 

I am interested in the use of music in public spaces and how perceptions and attitudes of these spaces by users might shift/change if the auditory environment could be susceptible to participation/interaction

Shared Interactive Music Experiences in Public Spaces: User Engagement and Motivations

CONCERNS: 



*   By nature this data is secretive, probably?

**Topic 3: Analyzing and Visualizing Text and TV**

Studs Terkel, Bill Moyers, Joseph Campbell, BPB/Will Oldham, Alan Licht

Overarching question: how can I transform written text (collected oral histories, interviews) into a meaningful visually designed project that informs the viewer of what this data represents?

Research question 1: 

I am studying the oral history works of Studs Terkel because I am fascinated by him as a figure/historian in order for other people to know about these works and keep these stories present in our current moment.  

Research question 2:

 I am interested in the written texts and recorded media of Bill Moyers because I want to know more about how his collected works and the ideas represented within them can reflect meaning for our contemporary political/social moment, in order to put this work in front of an audience who might not have engaged with it previously (or provide the opportunity to engage with it differently.) 

Research question 3: 

I am interested in two written texts focused on the musician/artist Bonnie "Prince" Billy (Will Oldham) because I want to know more about how textual lyric content can meaningfully and visually connect with contextual interview information and to explore any presented thematic synchronicities or disharmonies in order to present these works in a new context. 

Research question 4:  

I am interested in visualizing the history of a century of _Sound Art,_ as written about in Alan Licht's 2007 book about artists working in cross-genre spaces that emerged new methods of experiencing and engaging in auditory and visual artistic experiences because I want to know more about this movement in order to present the information in a new context to bring a new experience to the audience engaging with the material. 

Research question 5:

Same as above -- except for using Joseph Campbell's the Power of Myth as the source text.

Precedent 1: 

[https://densho.org/](https://densho.org/) - _Densho's mission is to preserve the testimonies of Japanese Americans who were unjustly incarcerated during World War II before their memories are extinguished. We offer these irreplaceable firsthand accounts, coupled with historical images and teacher resources, to explore principles of democracy, and promote equal justice for all. Densho is a Japanese term meaning "to pass on to the next generation," or to leave a legacy._

CONCERNS:  How to meaningfully extract the data from these works of text, or other media (recorded audio, television/film clips)
