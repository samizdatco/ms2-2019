I would like to talk to each of the three individuals listed above to deepen my understanding (and ideally my access as well) to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting. In addition to furthering my research questions, I would hope to be able to see a broader scope of entries within the archive and the associated metadata.

Re: Pirate Radio and Free Radio Broadcasting

5.) David Goren (Audio Producer and Founder of WBAD)
Mr. Goren is featured in the New Yorker piece that brought my attention to the use of pirate radio in Brooklyn neighborhoods serving immigrant communities. I believe his insights into the medium could help shape/focus/narrow my research.

6.) Andrew Yoder (pirate radio historian and broadcaster)
I discovered Mr. Yoder via the documentary linked below, which contains footage back from 1985. He has written several books on the subject. However, it is not clear to me where he lives.
