      <h1>A Right to Private/Secure Medical Data: Demystifying the Data Breach</h1>

      <div class="intro">
	      <p>This study raises awareness on the data breach with a special focus on protected medical data breaches (i.e. patient health data).  Security-related breaches are happening at an unprecedented rate.  In parallel, laws are being added and modified in an attempt to keep pace with the changing security landscape.  This work helps to demystify and raise awareness about data breaches with a special focus on patient health information.  In the United States, certain patient health information is regulated under federal legislation, entitled HIPAA/HITECH, and at the state level.  It is possible that certain cities may (one day also) have their own laws about patient health information.  At the Federal level, HIPAA/HITECH Privacy and Security Rules are enforced by the   <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/compliance-enforcement/index.html">Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights</a>.   Our awareness visualizations were created based on news articles, public government data, and interviews with institutional directors of Information Security.  </p>

      <h2>On patient health data reported breaches, what were the causes of the breaches?</h2>
      <section class="argument-col">
        
        <div class="text">
          <p>HIPAA/HITECH covered entities which fall victim to data breaches, may be indicated on the OCR data breach portal.  The OCR categorizes
	  breaches into five main categories: Hacking/IT incident, Improper Disposal, Loss, Theft, and Unauthorized Access/Disclosure.  The 
	  graph shows the proportion at which this standard incidents occurs.
	  <br>
	  </p>
	   <p>HIPAA covered entities and their business associates are the main sources for data breaches.  Typically, OCR categories sources of 
	  data breaches as Healthcare Provider, Health Plan, and Business Associate.  This graph reports the proportion of breaches by their source.</p>
