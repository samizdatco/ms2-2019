      <div class="intro">
	<p>This study raises awareness on the data breach with a special focus on HIPAA breaches.  Security-related breaches
	are happening at an unprecedented rate.  In parallel, laws are being added and modified to adjust to help with the 
        changing security landscape.  This work helps to demystify and raise awareness about data breaches with a special focus on
	patient health information.  Our awareness visualizations were created based on news articles, public government data,
	and interviews with institutional directors of Information Security.  </p>

          <p>HIPAA covered entities which fall victim to data breaches, may be indicated on the OCR data breach portal.  The OCR categorizes
