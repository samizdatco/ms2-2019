        <p>Introduction</p>
	<p>This study raises awareness on the data breach with a special focus on HIPAA breaches.  Security-related breaches
	are happening at an unprecedented rate.  In parallel, laws are being added and modified to adjust to help with the 
        changing security landscape.  This work helps to demystify and raise awareness about data breaches with a special focus on
	patient health information.  Our awareness visualizations were created based on news articles, public government data,
	interviews with institutional Information Security directors.  </p>

        <div class="text">
          <p>HIPAA covered entities are required to put in place a Business Associates agreement when business associates obtain
	  the protected data from covered entities.  The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) maintains a portal of breaches under 
	  investigation.  Their data shows how many breaches occurred by state with and without a proper Business Associates agreement.</p>

      <h2>On patient health data reported breaches, what were the causes of the breaches?</h2>

        <div class="text">
          <p>HIPAA covered entities which fall victim to data breaches, may be indicated on the OCR data breach portal.  The OCR categorizes
	  breaches into five main categories: Hacking/IT incident, Improper Disposal, Loss, Theft, and Unauthorized Access/Disclosure.  The 
	  graph shows the proportion at which this standard incidents occurs.</p>

      <h2>On patient health data reported breaches, which party is responsible for the breach?</h2>

        <div class="text">
          <p>HIPAA covered entities and their business associates are the main sources for data breaches.  Typically, OCR categories sources of 
	  data breaches as Healthcare Provider, Health Plan, and Business Associate.  This graph reports the proportion of breaches by their source.</p>

      <h2>On patient health data reported breaches, how many individuals were affected by state?</h2>
