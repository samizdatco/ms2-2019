## Kumar, Arun. Understanding the Black Economy & Black Money in India. New Delhi:Aleph Book Company, 2017.

HF 54 82.65.I4 K863 2017

Printed in 2017, this was an interesting read.  The book begins with an overview of economic difficulties in India including the sudden announcements in 2016 that certain currency notes would no longer be considered legal tender (p. ix).  And concludes (p. 109) that even the definition of the term 'black economy' is racially loaded and inappropriate. (Perhaps the end conclusion should have been an introduction and the book titled alternative marketplaces.)  This book connects to data breaches from the perspective of motivation.  The book (p.56) discusses what fuels the alternative economy and references: low salaries, high rates of inflation, high tax rates, and high degrees of controls.

### Questions

2. The historical aspect of the book could parallel histories of data breaches as paralleled with laws, controls, and education.
3. Similar to #2, are data breaches timed with other historically significant events (e.g. currency changes, etc.)

1. Is the timeline and events leading upto a breach predictable?
2. Are there key indicators across all technology which can identify abnormal behavior?
3. Can we use this history (e.g. customer reactions) to empower the future to inform how attacks are dealt with?

3. Where does responsibility end for these products?  
4. The more technology we have the more attack surfaces are potentially available, are legal requirements and educational needs in place for future growth?
