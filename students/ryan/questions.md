# Identifying a Topic

## Assignment

1. Select up to three _Subjects_
2. For each, come up with at least 5 _Topic_ + _Question_ + _Significance_ combinations
3. For each, identify nature of the data you’d need (and some preexisting sources if you have them)
4. For each Subject, look on the web for three precedents (data vis, research projects, articles, books, etc.)

## Subject 1: Housing Segregation in NY and Westchester

Topic: | _I am studying..._ | _...because I want to find out..._ | _...in order to help my reader understand..._
--- | --- | --- | ---
1. | the pervasiveness of (racial) housing segregation in New York City and Westchester County | how communities’ access to (suburban) housing opportunities differ | the real-world state of systemic racial injustice in New York by more deeply understanding the current state of housing segregation |
2. | the implementation and enforcement of the 1968 Fair Housing Act (FHA) in NYC and Westchester County | how this landmark civil rights policy aimed at promoting housing integration has failed or succeeded | how political decisions around enforcement of this policy has contributed to continued discrimination against racial minorities
3. | public housing in NYC and Westchester county | how concentrated public housing is in predominantly poor or non-white neighborhoods | how public housing policy decisions can exacerbate or alleviate racial housing segregation
4. | redlining maps and policies in NY and Westchester County | what effect these practices of denying insurance and banking services to areas deemed ‘undesirable’ have had on the wealth/poverty of these communities | the bigger question of how systemic racism (and racist policies) can hinder the socio-economic progression of its victims for decades and generations.
5. | the intersection of housing and educational segregation in Westchester County | what effects housing segregation has on access to quality education | the broader context of how housing segregation contributes to poor educational outcomes and the current-day legacy of ’separate but equal’ policies
6. | the Great Migration and White Flight | why these massive migrations of people from South to North and from cities to suburbs occurred | how these phenomena helped shape the current landscape of segregation in New York

## Subject 2: Partisanship, Polarization, and Gridlock in Congress

Topic: | _I am studying..._ | _...because I want to find out..._ | _...in order to help my reader understand..._
--- | --- | --- | ---
1. | members of past and present congress’ voting records | how frequently members of congress vote along party lines | understand the broader history of how partisanship influences the voting habits of Congress and how partisan recent Congresses have become
2. | the laws passed throughout the history of the US Congress | how congressional ‘productivity’ differs in divided / unified governments and in different political eras | the broader context of how partisanship contributes to political gridlock / compromise (especially in considering whether recent governments are especially more or less partisan / gridlocked than in the past)
3. | the voting patterns of individual members of congress | what the conservative/liberal ideological spectrum of current Congresses and individual Congress members are | how party ideology has shifted over time and understand the history behind the government’s (and each political party’s) current ideological landscape
4. | the so-called ’Southern Strategy’ | this strategy influenced the ideological composition of elected legislators from Southern states that represented each party | how the Republican party created a consistent and overwhelming coalition in the South
5. | the Voting Right Act of 1965 | how this policy has contributed to the formulation of single-party districts | the history behind how this policy aimed at enabling political representation for underserved communities has contributed to the current state of political polarization
6. | the voting networks of members of congress | how frequently certain members of Congress with differing ideologies vote together | how prevalent the process of logrolling is and how it works in the legislature (specifically, is it strong enough to cut across partisan or ideological lines?)
7. | US Congressional budgets | how Congressional ideology is reflected in budgetary decisions | how Congress uses the budget process to instill its ideological leanings on government functions and national politics
