        <p>This paragraph should introduce the racial wealth gap and housing's role in it.
        It should introduce the federal policies that created the post-Great Depression mortgage market boom and a surge in homeownership rates nationwide.
        It should explain how African Americans were shut out of that market, and how that created a vicious negative feedback loop.
        </p>
        <p>This paragraph should orient the user to the analysis approach and perspective of what they should see as they continue down the page.
          It should explain that we're exploring how redlining maps give us a lens into housing discrimination practices and that we're exploring
          how they impact housing markets in present-day New York, which is still one of the most segregated cities in the United States.

                the racial motivations behind the gradings, and what the gradings were across New York.

            <p>
              The goal of this section is to compare the change in racial composition, homeownership, and home value over time for a selected small handfull of neighborhoods.
              These neighborhoods should start out with similar metrics but diverge over time, ending up with different racial compositions and/or real estate markets.
              This type of comparison should portray how housing discrimination affected wealth building and homeownership opportunities within these particular neighborhoods.
              Hopefully I can anchor this story with specific examples of particular houses that were sold, images of the neighborhood today, etc.

              At this point, the user should have a broad understanding of how redlining and housing discrimination operated in the mid-30's,
              where avenues for wealth-building homeownership were available and unavailable in New York,
              what legacy access to these avenues has on New York's segregated housing market today,
              and stories of neighborhoods or houses with different levels of access to these avenues and their resulting differences in home value, ownership, and wealth-building opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user should leave understanding the <b>generational</b> implications of housing discrimination
               – why just preventing future discrimination won't be enough to address today's levels of residential segregation and racial wealth disparities.
               I will also aim to open up the data visualization to exploration once the guided narrative is done, allowing users to explore the map, scatter-plot, and/or neighborhood details for areas in New York that interest them.
