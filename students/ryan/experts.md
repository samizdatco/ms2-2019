1. [__Nikole Hannah Jones__](https://nikolehannahjones.com/) is an award-winning reporter with The New York Times Magazine, covering civil rights and racial injustice.

Her perspective on how to connect this policy with current indicators in order to demonstrate the legacies of redlining on current-day New York would be invaluable.
