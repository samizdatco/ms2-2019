## Poole, Keith T., and Howard Rosenthal. _Congress: A Political-economic History of Roll Call Voting._ Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997.

JK1051 .P66 1997

Poole and Rosenthal establish a 'spatial model' for explaining the results of roll call voting in Congress, finding that the vast majority of congressional votes can be explained using this simple model that describes each legislator in an ideological continuum from Left (liberal) to Right (conservative). Roll call votes can then be described as splits along this continuum comparing a legislator's position with a critical point being voted on – everyone to one side of that point votes one way, and everyone on the other votes the other way. For the majority of roll call voting, the nodes of this continuum have also represented loyalty to the two political parties of the time, primarily capturing the main economic conflicts between the two parties. Usually, there is also a second continuum (usually with a weaker effect) at play that may break parties into separate factions – the strongest or most important of which have revolved around issues of race.

### Questions
1. Party loyalty is parsed out here as the primary explanatory factor in roll call voting, with each legislator's loyalty existing on a spectrum – what is the legacy or history of strong/weak party loyalty in congress (clustering of legislators at the poles)? ("the two parties will likely gravitate toward a system more polarized than at any time since the early 1920s." – pg. 85)
2. This model will be more effective at explaining voting behavior at the poles than at the margins - how frequently do these "moderate" voters vote against their party on moderate and/or polarized bills?
3. The model suggests that there is relative stability in voting patterns, that members of congress stay relative consistent in their ideology, and shifts are caused by turnover of representatives – what were the ideological shifts in congress over time (if party-line voting is consistently high)?

## Davis, Tom, Martin Frost, and Richard E. Cohen. _The Partisan Divide: Congress in Crisis._ Campbell, CA: Premiere, 2014.

JK1021 .D39 2014

Davis and Frost explore the causes of gridlock and polarization in the U.S. legislative body, of which they were both formerly members of, that have developed over the last couple decades. These former representatives cite single party districts (caused by gerrymandering, residential sorting patterns, and the Voting Rights Act), the highly ideological media, and evolutions in campaign finance reform that has taken the money away from political parties and into the hands of special interests at the poles. Both voters and legislators are acting in a more parliamentary fashion: voter habits show an increase in party-line voting, as constituents vote based exclusively on a candidate's party and are submitting less split-ticket ballots, while legislators themselves are engaging in less compromise and approach legislating as two opposing forces fighting at odds with one another.

### Questions
1. How do we quantify/measure congressional compromise (or lack thereof)? What quantitative evidence is there of how this has changed (increased) in recent administrations?
2. The authors seem to use the concept of bills passed as a measure of effectiveness or gridlock, while also explaining that there has been many examples of divided government recently where control of specific branches of government change hands rapidly and no party has held onto all three for a significant period of time – has this always been the case? Is there historical precedent for a divided government passing significantly more laws?
3. Much of the analysis presented in this book focus on voter behavior over legislator voting behavior – what place should each one have in an analysis of polarization or party-line voting? How has polarization manifested in voter behavior? In legislator voting? _Should my research question focus in on one or the other, or instead will I be raising a question that will need support from both these data sources?_

## Lamb, Charles M. _Housing Segregation in Suburban America since 1960 Presidential and Judicial Politics._ Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005.

HD7288.76.U5 L36 2005

Racial segregation in housing is an issue that has consistently plagued the United States and is a readily apparent issue in contemporary American society. This book traces the promises of and the failures to maintain or enforce suburban integration (the Fair Housing Act) between the late 1960s and 2000s by focusing primarily on the presidency and suburban housing opportunities for African Americans during this timeframe. This book argues that the nation's suburbs are still segregated due to problems rooted in American politics, policy, and law – policies to (at best) neglect enforcement of suburban housing integration that were established in the Nixon administration and have remained unchanged throughout the five subsequent administrations – in addition to discriminatory housing practices. This housing segregation is also explained to "...contribute to segregated schools, limited access to suburban job opportunities, concentrations of wealth and poverty, and other troublesome aspects of American life." (p. 254)

3. Where has the relative African American suburban population size grown/shrunk? Where (if anywhere) have suburbs become more/less integrated? What has that meant for economic/societal indicators for those areas?

## Dodson, Dan W. _Racial Factors in Public Elementary Education Mt. Vernon ; New York._ New York: New York University, Center for Human Relations, 1964.

LD3910.E3 H9 no.13

This book is a report on the racial distribution of pupils across the school system in Mount Vernon, NY in 1964 by [Dan W. Dodson](https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/19/obituaries/dan-w-dodson-88-foe-and-scholar-of-racism.html). This report lays out the state of racial segregation in Mount Vernon at this time, reporting on the high discrepancies in non-white populations at the schools above and below the New Haven railroad and providing relevant physical and educational context behind the problem. Finally, Dodson evaluates some potential rectifying solutions to this segregation, ultimately recommending a new school organization of having schools north of the tracks serve first through third grade, and schools below serve fourth through sixth grade. This proposal would move away from the neighborhood-based school focus, instead requiring substantial busing to have students of the same grades from across Mount Vernon attend the same school. He then discussed the costs of this plan, educational and societal considerations, and a summarization of the importance of pursuing and achieving school integration in Mount Vernon.

3. Which plan (if any) recommended by Dodson was implemented? Was it successful? Why (or why not)?

## Carr, James H., and Nandinee K. Kutty. _Segregation: The Rising Costs for America._ New York: Routledge, 2008.

HD7288.76.U5 S38 2008

This book documents how residential segregated has been produced and propagated by discriminatory practices in housing markets, practices that continue today. The authors also connect this segregation with significant disparities in access to quality jobs, education, homeownership, and wealth between minority and majority communities. These issues are framed as vital to the economic and sociological health of the entire American society – solutions that create a more just society would benefit all Americans and investing in these solutions is crucial to the long-term economic vitality and global competitiveness of the United States as a whole.

## Hillstrom, Laurie Collier. _Black Lives Matter: From a Moment to a Movement._ Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, an Imprint of ABC-CLIO, LLC, 2018.

E185.615 .H518 2018

Hillstrom documents the origins of the #BlackLivesMatter campaign, detailing the events that lead up to the creation of the twitter hashtag, how this digital moment grew into a national movement of protest and social justice advocacy, and the expansion of this movement into the broader world of systemic racial injustice in America. She demonstrates how legacies (and high-profile instances) of police violence towards black individuals provided the spark that started BLM, exploring how this movement gained steam and the criticism and backlash that resulted along the way. Finally, Hillstrom discusses a range of systems and statistics that illuminate "...the broad, systemic factors that hinder the progress of black citizens and communities, such as racial disparities in income, employment, housing, health, and education" that are being increasingly targeted by the BLM movement (pg. 80).
