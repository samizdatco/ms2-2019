# Questions

"A *subject* is a broad area of knowledge (e.g., climate change), while a *topic* is a specific interest within that area (e.g., the effect of climate change on migratory birds). However, finding a topic is not simply a matter of narrowing your subject. A topic is an approach to a subject, one that asks a question whose answer solves a problem that your readers care about."
