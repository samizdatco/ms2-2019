'Popular Music & Society' is an academic and theoretical survey of pop music. The first two chapters focus on the structure of pop music, from economics to sociology of production. Later chapters review commentary rising from pop music itself: Chapter 3 looks at the history of pop music, especially in terms of politics and sexuality; Chapter 4 uses what's discussed in Chapter 3 for a case study on "black music"; Chapter 5 analyzes the actual text of pop music; and Chapter 6 dives into the performance of pop music. The last three chapters address pop music audiences. Chapter 7 looks at consumption, Chapter 8 looks at past literature on fans, and Chapter 9 looks at subcultures and the idea of a "scene."

The goal of this book is to shift focus in music literature from the recording industry to live music. It's a socio-economic survey of "the role which live music has played in British cultural life since 1950," analyzing the relationship recording and live has had throughout the last 60 years (wthout just focusing on sales and charts). The authors argue  by looking at music history through the lens of live performance, a sense of place and an enhanced political undertone is added to the discussion.

"Popular Music Fandom" separates itself from other cultural studies about popular music by shifting focus to the fan as the core subject of study. The book examines fandoms as a cultural phenomenon and how the concept has changed with the internet. It attempts to better define the idea of a fan and how it relates to social identity. The topic of fandom is linked to pop music studies, audience research, and media fandom.

After being a band in Manchester for nearly 10 years, their official debut album as the 1975 hit No. 1 on the UK charts in 2013.
