Project Title:	
Travel in Womenâ€™s Professional Tennis

One sentence description:	
A visual exploration of the annual path and travel efficiency for the top 30 women tennis players on the WTA for 2018.

One paragraph description:	
Tennis is unique from other sports with the fact that there are no "home games" or "regional conferences" for the players and all tournaments take place in different cities throughout the world. Players on the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) tour typically spend 10+ months of the year on the road, which could include weekly change of climates and altitudes. This project explores the annual travel path for the top 30 women tennis players in 2018 and outlines what efficiency is needed to reach the top 10.
