Call number: HB501.B655 2005

Bogle’s book reflects on the purpose of the financial system, notably published before the 2008-2009 financial crisis.

### Guthrie, Graeme A. *The Firm Divided: Manager-Shareholder Conflict and the Fight for Control of the Modern Corporation*. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2017.

Call number: HD2741.G88 2017

This book investigates manager-shareholder conflicts in large corporations. These conflicts arise as, basically, shareholders want managers to pursue the shareholder value maximization, but managers ultimately want to maximize their own wellbeing. The outcome of manager-shareholder conflict is largely determined by a firm’s board of directors, which represents the shareholders’ interests. The book shows how boards monitor managers, and the problems they face when doing so. It shows how boards provide incentives for managers to work in shareholders’ best interests, using a combination of ownership stakes and performance-based pay.

### Lo, Andrew. *Adaptive markets: financial evolution at the speed of thought*. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2017.

Call number: EZB-TNS-11254913

The author finds that he efficient markets hypothesis should be extended by a theory that takes in account insights from behavioral finance and frames markets as a human-made biological ecosystem, including the Darwinist and evolutional tendencies therein. He coins this theory as the adaptive markets hypothesis. The adaptive markets theory states that humans make best guesses based on trial and error – and in that sense are fallible not only in their approach itself but also in the process of selecting a better approach.

**Subjects:**

- Main topic: Financial markets
- Other tags: Rational choice; Investments - Psychological aspects, decision-making

**Questions:**
1.	What is the relevance of the efficient markets hypothesis, and how does it underpin the attractiveness of index-investing?
2.	Where does the efficient markets hypothesis fall short in explaining investors’ behavior?
3.	How does index-investing fit into the theory of adaptive markets?

### Additional books
*(Only online accessible)*

#### Boubaker, Sabri, Cumming, Douglas and Nguyen, Duc Khuong. *Research Handbook of Finance and Sustainability*. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar Publishing, 2018

This book provides a coverage and practical recommendations on a wide array of pertinent issues related to current finance and sustainability research.

#### Bogle, John C. * Stay the Course: The Story of Vanguard and the Index Revolution*. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2019.
John Bogle was one of the most outspoken advocates of index-investing. This book chronicles his path from the rationale in his grad-school economics research on mutual funds, to the founding of Vanguard in 1974 that created the first index fund available to individual investors. Key to his beliefs, Bogle finds that the only way to maximize the people’s share of the financial returns they earn as a group is by minimizing their costs (as opposed to maximizing their profit). The book provides an overview of his core ideas and his reflections over time, tested by putting his ideas in practice.
