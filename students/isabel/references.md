### Lo, Andrew. *Adaptive markets: financial evolution at the speed of thought*. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2017.

Call number: EZB-TNS-11254913

The author finds that he efficient markets hypothesis should be extended by a theory that takes in account insights from behavioral finance and frames markets as a human-made biological ecosystem, including the Darwinist and evolutional tendencies therein. He coins this theory as the adaptive markets hypothesis. The adaptive markets theory states that humans make best guesses based on trial and error – and in that sense are fallible not only in their approach itself but also in the process of selecting a better approach. This book provides an interesting context as the efficient markets theory is key to the concept of index-investing.

**Subjects:**

- Main topic: Financial markets
- Other tags: Rational choice; Investments - Psychological aspects, decision-making

**Questions:**
1. What is the relevance of the efficient markets hypothesis, and how does it underpin the attractiveness of index-investing?
2. Where does the efficient markets hypothesis fall short in explaining investors’ behavior?
3. How does index-investing fit into the theory of adaptive markets?

### Bogle, John C. *The battle for the soul of capitalism*. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005.

Call number: HB501.B655 2005

Bogle’s book reflects on the purpose of the financial system, notably published before the 2008-2009 financial crisis. He calls out how owners’ capitalism – running business largely for the benefit of the providers of capital – has been replaced by a new set of norms where managers run business largely for their own benefit.

### Shaxson, Nicholas. * The finance curse : how global finance is making us all poorer*. London: The Bodley Head, 2018.
Call number: HG3881.S538 2018g

This book makes the alarming claim that modern finance is broken where it predominantly extracts rent from society at large, instead of fostering wealth. The author finds that contemporary finance did not only become useless, but also socially damaging. 

**Subjects:**
- LLC caption: Finance
- Other tags: Rational choice; Investments - Psychological aspects, decision-making

**Questions:**
1.	What is the “financialization of the world”: how did the roles of banking and capital markets change?

### Millstein, Ira. *The Activist Director : Lessons from the Boardroom and the Future of the Corporation*. New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2016.
Call number: HD2745 .M527 2017

Millstein shares concerns with criticisms expressed by Bogle and (later) Shaxson on how the imperatives of directors and their company's shareholders are problematic, or at least ill-managed. He denounces a form of passivist governance that arose from the current capital markets structure, which leads to bad leadership and enables corporate malpractice. Millstein's solution is not more regulation, nor the expansion of shareholder rights. Inspired by shareholder activism, he calls for activist directors who are as involved as activists. The relevance of this book for my research is Milltstein' alternative perspective on the issue of how shareholders' interests and good governance have become increasingly dependent on large asset managers and proxy-advisors. His focus is with not with the asset managers, nor with the shareholders, but rather with the corporates themselves. For him, constructive shareholder activism means installing the soundest directors.

**Subjects:** 
- LLC caption: Economic history and conditions
- Other tags: Shareholder activism, corporate governance, agency problems

**Questions:**
1. What is the development described by Millstein as it comes to how shareholders' rights are represented?
2. What problems does Millstein identify with proxy advisors? 
3. What kind of shareholder activism does Millstein endorse?

### Guthrie, Graeme A. *The Firm Divided: Manager-Shareholder Conflict and the Fight for Control of the Modern Corporation*. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2017.

Call number: HD2741.G88 2017

Whereas Millstein adopts a normative approach, Gurthie's book offers a descriptive account of the role of directors relative to owners. The book investigates manager-shareholder conflicts in large corporations. These conflicts arise as, basically, shareholders want managers to pursue the shareholder value maximization, but managers ultimately want to maximize their own wellbeing. The outcome of manager-shareholder conflict is largely determined by a firm’s board of directors, which represents the shareholders’ interests. The book shows how boards monitor managers, and the problems they face when doing so. It shows how boards provide incentives for managers to work in shareholders’ best interests, using a combination of ownership stakes and performance-based pay.

**Subjects:**

- LLC caption: Economic history and conditions
- Other tags:: Corporate governance; Stockholders; Boards of directors

**Questions:**

1. What is the basic structure underlying the delegation of owners to management?
2. What makes for effective boards in mitigating negative outcomes from manger-shareholder conflicts?
3. In what scenarios is shareholder activism more likely to be successful, according to the author?

#### Boubaker, Sabri, Cumming, Douglas and Nguyen, Duc Khuong. *Research Handbook of Finance and Sustainability*. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar Publishing, 2018

This book provides a coverage and practical recommendations on a wide array of pertinent issues related to current finance and sustainability research.

#### Bogle, John C. *Stay the Course: The Story of Vanguard and the Index Revolution*. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2019.
John Bogle was one of the most outspoken advocates of index-investing. This book chronicles his path from the rationale in his grad-school economics research on mutual funds, to the founding of Vanguard in 1974 that created the first index fund available to individual investors. Key to his beliefs, Bogle finds that the only way to maximize the people’s share of the financial returns they earn as a group is by minimizing their costs (as opposed to maximizing their profit). The book provides an overview of his core ideas and his reflections over time, tested by putting his ideas in practice.
