Interview March 15, 2019, 3PM 


GM: I was setting up the google hangout and sent you the questions beforehand. Did you get did you get that or no? 

AH: No, but I think it should be okay.

GM: Okay, so [I’m in] my last semester of my grad school program and so I'm going for my masters of science and data viz and for my thesis topic was just really fascinated by the storage unit industry - and how much is grown. I'm surprised in some ways that's like not covered more, just because it's like a booming industry seems to be having to have like a low amount of employees, and low over- head in some ways and it's like pretty recession-proof. So I'm excited to get your Insight on it. To someone who is unfamiliar with this industry. How would you describe it?

AH: I would describe it as s secure place outside your home to keep your extra belongings and  so the industry is pretty much a real estate business that creates that extra storage space.
And basically sells its people, people on a monthly basis.

GM: What do you think are the most compelling aspects of it?

AH: Is it something that you know, we as a society are always seem to be accumulating more things. I think it's kind of hard wired in our brains from you know thousands of years of the survival of the human species, you know when you come across something valuable don’t get rid of it, you keep it, and now are in this modern society where it’s hard to let go of things. So everything kind of has a value, when you possess something it becomes valuable to you. And we have more possessions than ever, and so that this whole you know, it's very compelling but we have more stuff than we had places to put it pretty much. So this is this is the whole reason why storage exists people moving and relocating its a very useful during those times so that that's also another compelling part of storage is it just if you follow where the people are moving to, then that’s where storage is also going to be very successful. There’s just always this need in our lives when we get disrupted and we're moving or something happens in our personal life or we have to basically, you know put our stuff somewhere temporarily because we've been uprooted or something like that. Basically, you know, put our stuff somewhere temporarily because we've been uprooted or something like that. And then also, the other compelling part is just how it’s grown in the last in a few years. Like you said there's been I think during the recession, after the recession it was difficult for developers to get financing to build more facilities. So what happened was you ended up with the population kept growing there still a need for storage, people kept buying things. So you had this tremendous pent-Up demand because there was no new facilities being built. So the ones that were open, were basically filled up, prices were rising because of supply and demand. Then around about you know, how about five five years ago the financing started to open up again. And that's when you had this building boom right now. There's a big building boom across the country kind of started, you know in Texas and you know, smaller markets, or bigger markets markets, New York, Florida, Texas, and they're still there still doing really well. Denver, Portland. All these cities, a lot of these cities are where a lot of the Millennials are moving to, creating more demand and more need for storage. So it’s been this really interesting story. The industry's been trying to catch up with demand. In some cases maybe they’re building a little too much and they're going to have problems filling in the space, but I guess that happens in any kind of boom situation. But it’s a very localized industry. 
You know, if you look at a city, there's little submarkets within each City. So storage units usually operate, they draw customers from like a 1-mile to 3 Mile to 5 mile radius. So, if you have too many facilities in one little pocket then that’s a problem, but if they're spaced out kind of evenly throughout an area, it’s not that big of a deal.

GM: How do they [storage industry participants] figure that out? Do they share all that data? Like where to locate themselves? 

AH: Yeah, there’s companies that do data research in this field. One of them is called Union Real Time. That's just one example, but you know, they pretty much they will track development…

GM: to figure out the optimal place to…

AH: yeah, exactly, and they kind of will, you know, they can even show you on a map like “this is like, this new facility being built here, you know in like so you might want to avoid that area if you want to build something like close by, you know, you can build it here” sort of thing.

GM: What are the biggest changes you’ve seen since you’ve started covering it [the industry]?

AH: Aside from the building aspect, because when I first started it was very slow. Just in the last five years, right now we are in a peak year of construction or deliveries as far as new facilities opening. Maybe it will continue into next year. But you know, this is kind of like the plateau where we're at the top. So, you know, it's expected that new facilities will kind slow down after this year, but you know that remains to be seen.
The big change has been the kind of new competitors, kind of too traditional storage that have been trying to disrupt the industry, which is sort of the on-demand valet storage operators. Are you familiar with those at all?

GM: Is that separate from the storage unit industry? 

AH: Yeah, it’s separate from the industry but it’s kind of going after the same customer in a way. A little bit of overlap in the customer. These are like new startup companies where basically they will come to your house and pick up your stuff and then take it to a warehouse like outside of the city. So it's kind of cheaper or the same price as storage. And if you want your stuff they will bring it back to you. So they're trying to challenge the whole Self Storage industry as far as like being inconvenient, you know, if you have to take your own stuff to the place. So that’s been really interesting, and those have been kind of slow to grow and take off. I mean they haven’t really posed any threat really but it’s been interesting to watch.

GM: So even though they are similar in industry, they’re seeing that as competition in a way? Right?

AH: Yeah, I think they’d like to be the competition, but it’s such a niche, it’s such a new thing. A lot of people don’t know about it and don’t realize it exists. So that’s their biggest challenge. That on-demand storage, their biggest challenge is getting awareness and getting people to become familiar with the concept. I mean everyone knows storage, self-storage makes sense. Now you go drop off your own thing, but the on-demand they’re more successful in New York, Chicago, these big cities where a lot of people don’t have car and it’s hard to get around. So it just might be a niche kind of thing like that. But it’s been interesting.
And then, you know also back to the traditional self-storage, this might be something you're more interested in. It is kind of the rise of unmanned facilities where they don’t have anybody on site at all. 

GM: like it’s all AI, security.....

AH: Yeah, all automated, like you have a kiosk that people can buy a lock from or sign their paperwork on a touch screen and stuff like. So they’re open 24 hours and that's like kind of like even more convenient kind of thing. And then the technology, you know available now is making that possible. That wasn’t around 10, 12, 20 years ago plus like better security stuff, so that's been interesting too.
They don't hire a lot of people, you know necessarily on the ground you have managers of facilities, you know.
And then you have people that are kind of above those that are managing like the pricing and that sort of stuff. You might need to be like a regional manager sort of thing. 

GM: That’s what I find fascinating about it. When I look at the square footage of say McDonald's and Starbucks which are known to be ubiquitous. And storage units, not only are they everywhere, they’re way bigger but they have such a smaller amount of employees in comparison for their size, at least in square footage. And also what I would assume a smaller footprint. And by footprint, I mean customer footprint of people going into these spaces...

AH: oh like during the day...?

GM: Yeah

AG: and a lot of them don’t have the same parking requirements.
You don't have to rush really like you had like people coming in and out throughout the day, but, you know, it's spread out. 

GM: I read one report where it said that like “adding a bathroom is like an additional feature to a storage unit that would possibly bring people there” and that it would be an attractive feature for certain customers, which I find interesting.

AH: They’ve been trying to... the old self-storage facility is kind of like outdoor, barbed wire, like doesn't look great like just looks like a warehouse type building. But now like they're building with more architecture, aesthetics in mind, you know trying to make them look more like office buildings, like class and steel, multi-story, you know.

GM: I had a question about that actually, because I noticed that a lot of the buildings, even though they’re owned by different companies they all kind look the same and have similar aesthetic and I was wondering if you knew why that was the case.

AH: That’s a good question. I think so... generally there’s some zoning questions involved with these places. You have a lot of times like, a community, or a municipality or something they don't necessarily love storage facilities partly because they don't hire a lot of people so like you said like there isn't like that jobs aspects to them and so they don't generate jobs necessarily except for the construction jobs temporarily. But, and they also don't like the look of the old self storage facilities. So there’s been kind of this movement to modernize them and make them look more visually appealing so that they can get approved and municipalities. You know, they look to look more like an office building or an apartment building. So trying to blend in with with you no other types of modern architecture.
I think it's kind of created this kind of aesthetic standard, you know that they all sort of strive for in and ya know know the ones that you know do sort of succeed everyone wants to emulate those. So it's kind of Follow the Leade and everybody's kind of doing the same thing. I think so, you can eventually kind of evolve and they start to look sort of similar. Kind of like how all apartment buildings that are being built right now all kind of have that same like look and feel. I think it kind of happens organically but in response to kind of....

GM: low-cost? 

AH: Actually they’re more costly than ever, you know, they're more expensive to build but I think it's like you have to make them nice to get them zoned so that the municipality will allow you to build it. They don't want you to build a shack that looks like a bunch of brick, or not brick, but something industrial that you would see on like the bad side of town.

GM: So you're saying though they have a kind of a similar aesthetic because it kind of happened organically in a way... is that right?

AH: yeah, I think it's just happened coincidentally that, they’re all trying to compete so they want fall in line with each other. No one wants to, they’re not going to, they're trying to make them nicer, they’re trying to stand out and they're trying to get them approved by looking nicer, more inviting to customers and you know, you have a lot of architects and things like that working for different companies. So you kind, eventually this aesthetic has evolved and what you’re seeing, the kind of multi- story self storage facilities, has really evolved in the last 10 years to what it is today. 

GM: So you think it's becoming like better-looking and it’ll continue to improve? 

AH: Yeah, I think they’re just striving to kind of standout and to be more inviting to customers.

GM: What data did you find most surprising around this industry? Or surprising trends that you’ve seen?

AH: I think just the amount of growth. You’ve seen somewhere between 600 or 800 new facilities opening last year. Estimates vary but you know, it’s around that range, and last year the same. And then, that’s the most amount, you know, the peak... Like 2018 if you look at construction spending on self-storage, it’s the most ever. I think it’s more more than 5 billion dollars that has been spent on self-storage construction last year, which is more than ever. So that’s very interesting, so it’s like where do we go from here? 
Does it kind of plateau out? Does it fall off a cliff? Because we built all this property and they're just going to sit back and run it all. So it's it's really interesting to see I think from the customer perspective. I think it's interesting just how everybody eventually seems to use storage at some point, at any given time I think it’s around 10% use a storage unit.
That 10% is always rotating because people move in, move out. So it’s one of those things everybody has experience with eventually I think.
I think it's fascinating industry because it's...

GM: It’s growing so much too. 

AH: Yeah, it’s grown a lot and it follows the population. As the population grows there’s a greater need for storage, especially in the cities that are growing that are seeing net migration. That's where all the storage operators want to be because everybody's moving and you know. The other question is like, and it seems to have been actually answered in the last few years..how are millennials going to use self-storage? Do they have the same attachment to stuff as their parents? And things like that. I think it turns out that they do. 

GM: I was wondering about that. One approach I had initially when thinking about this as a thesis topic was how does this industry fare in comparison to minimalist movement and Marie kondo? And how does that affect that? It might be too soon [to tell], because I haven’t seen that data [to support that] just yet. There seems to be a stronger baby boomer generation that like is more attached to their stuff. Where is like, my generation, our generation may not be as much.

AH: But will you in 20 years from now? That's the question I guess.
And with the minimalist movement, it may end up being a benefit in a way because people, they realize they don’t want their stuff in their house and you're supposed to throw it away, or get rid of it, but not everybody is going to want to do that. They're going to just say well I'll just put it in a storage for now, so it's out of my house. So if anything it might help, who knows. Not everyone follows the rules there. But yeah, I think there’s always going to be a need. Millennials are big consumers as well. So, eventually, they're going to run out of space, especially because they're living in apartments and they're living in smaller spaces. It's just human nature, I think.

GM: Aside from population growth, are there other main causes to this consistent growth?

AH: No, I think that’s really the main reason. I mean think there’s also this certain, I mean aside from consumer spending habits and and you know people continuing to buy and also what I alluded to a moment ago, miillennials are living in smaller spaces, smaller homes. I think maybe the average m, you might want to double check this, but the average home size has been getting smaller as well. 

GM: Yes, I saw that as well. 

AH: So yeah, we are living in smaller spaces. So there’s less room to keep your stuff, especially people living in condos and things like that. So there's less room to keep everything.

GM: What do you wish people knew about this industry?  I’m sure when people when you tell people that you work in this industry, like they're like common things that they possibly ask you? 

AH: Yeah, I mean, I guess it's a little less than it used to. I mean maybe there more, but that may be confirmation bias. I think it’s just that it’s, I don’t know, that’s a tough one. I can’t think of anything good so...

GM: That’s ok! I think we are covering a lot. How would you describe the typical storage unit owner? A lot of them are owned by mom and pops, but there’s a lot that like public storage, but I'm just kind of curious of like, when I was sourcing through data there’s like a lot of marketing data like how to open up your own storage unit and how to market for it. And I'm not on the demographic for that so I was just curious who is the demographic for that?

AH: So ownership, about 18% of facilities are owned by the six largest companies right? 

GM: Yes. 

AH: They own thousands to hundreds of facilities and then the next 9% is owned by the top 100, and 73% is owned by small operators. Small operators, they own like maybe less than 10, maybe one facility. 

GM: It’s a fragmented industry, which is interesting. 

AH: And that 73% is very fragmented. You have small regional companies, they invested in the real estate. So it’s a real estate investment, some of them are passive investors. 
A lot of them have been around for a long time. You know, it's like a family business, you know, they they were part of the first wave first like group of, you know, Self Storage kind of took off in the seventies and eighties, you know, and they've been family businesses ever since then. So they own maybe they just own maybe a couple of facilities and maybe other businesses. A lot of them own other businesses as well like.Just depends. They’re they’re entrepreneurial type people so they’ll own, you know, like “oh I own a storage facility and I own a gas station too.”
Yeah, so they're all kinds of people, you know. And sometimes they’ll... Sometimes they manage their own facilities, sometimes they hire other companies to manage and they just are passive. It all depends. It’s a big range. I mean they are very diverse. It's a large group of people. So yeah, it’s like Mom and Pops. And sometimes you know they own one or two facilities and that’s it. 
It’s just a good regular income. 

GM: How would you describe the sort of breakdown of the demographics of the owners? Do they do they have one thing that's kind of in common?

AH: Of the mom and pops?

GM: Yeah, the Mom and Pop's versus of like the public or all together even.
Mom and pops [ownership] is kind of interesting in a way in that like if they're the same owners from the 70s. It's like kind of this easy way to kind of maintain a space, you know, and like keep regular revenue. 

AH: Yeah it is, and if the next generation wants to keep it going. And that’s the thing, that’s why a lot of these bigger groups have been growing because a lot of like a lot of those mom and pops are ready to exit the business. They’re ready to sell their facility and they're waiting for the right time to get the most you money for the facility. And the bigger companies are always buying quality facilities so there's been a lot of consolidation, you know, so over time...that number probably will go down.

GM: The 73% of small operators you mean? 

AH: I mean, I don’t know if you looked historically, but it has probably has gone down but I mean. I'd say it’s pretty similar to most real estate businesses demographically. I don't think there's much of a...big departure. 

GM: Yeah, I was curious about that because in like an environment where like larger corporations tend to take over smaller companies, right?

AH: Yeah, it happens. 

GM: Yeah, but I saw that in the storage unit industry that seems like it's still a large percentage of mom and pops, which I find really fascinating. So do you see that changing in the future? 

AH: I see that changing throughout the years and it’s s good business, and I guess,
I’m not going to say it’s an easy to run, but maybe it’s easier to run than maybe some other businesses, especially once it's like running. Some mom and pops, maybe their facilities are full, they have all their tenants that they need. And they're just content to get that income every month, when another more sophisticated operator, one of these bigger companies, they would come in and they would increase the rates. They would raise the rates. Some people would move out but there's so much demand other people would move in and pay that higher rate. So it's more active management, you know that they could get more value out of the facility because they have computer models and algorithms to tell them their pricing. Some Mom and Pop's, they still run their facility on index cards and out of a composition book, they're not necessarily, not all of them. You know it because it's a big number 73%.
But that’s the value that the big operators, that they can come in and kind of generate more revenue from the same facility, if that makes sense, through more sophisticated technology and management operations and things like that, you know. And a lot of these mom and pops just like the regular income. They're not worried about actively managing so much as these other companies are so maybe that's one reason. And they know that that offer will always be there when they're ready to retire or what not.

GM: But you see that kind of changing as things move forward.

AH: Yeah just you see the bigger, the top 100 and the 6 public companies, they regularly buy smaller companies, they buy portfolios of 50, 20 facilities sometimes. There’s not as many of those left, they actually acquired a lot of the bigger portfolios. Now they're kind of just picking up one or two, three, four, smaller mom and pop operations. Some mom and pops own a lot more facilities than one or two, it just depends. They might be in the top 100, they might own 10 or 12. So it's just it's all across the board I would say. 

GM: Do you know how often customers go to their unit? I was kind of curious to get the kind of foot traffic in the storage unit if there's any data on that.

AH: I don’t recall, I don't think it's very often. There’s probably a small percentage that frequent their units because they use it for business. A lot of, I think it’s 10-20% of units are business related, so they have small inventory or they have a little workshop there. An e-commerce business will keep their retail inventory or a restaurant will keep their extra, like a catering business will keep their extra tables and chairs and things like that. So they're going to be going to the facility more often than anybody else. But that’s like a small percentage maybe 15% or so of customers at any given facility. But generally, most people they don’t really have a need to go back and forth too many times. 

GM: Are you familiar with the Ibisworld research report? 

AH: Yeah, I’ve looked at it occasionally. 

GM: So I noticed there’s a dip in the industry value added in 2017, it was a negative number, and I was wondering if you knew why that possibly happened?

AH: The total value of the industry? It went from like 38 to 37. Is that what you mean? 

GM: Well it was an negative .2% but it was the only negative that I saw at least in recent years but then the revenue was still high but I didn’t know what meant. 

AH: What was the negative again? 


GM: It was negative in Industry value added in 2017.

AH: That’s a good question. I think either it was a change in their methodology of some kind. 

GM: Yeah it didn’t seem consistent. 

AH: Yeah, I don’t know.

GM: That's okay. I can send you again that I don't have it onhand but I can you again if that’s ok. And then the other one thing is that the was a storage industry is set for continued growth, do you think anything could derail that? 

AH: I think if there’s too much over building. It’s very market by market. Nationwide probably not but you might have certain parts of the country, certain cities, that if they over build and suddenly there's a recession that could be a potential hazard. But overall a recession. No, I think would have some impact. I don't think it would derail the industry. It's not resistant recession-proof, but it's recession resilient. You know, there is. Because it cuts both ways. Like you have people that maybe storage is expendable income or a discretionary kind of expense and they'll try to get rid of their storage units and that will happen. But then you also have people that will be displaced because they lose their homes or something of that nature. So it kind of balances out. You have people who find a job somewhere else, relocate. Things like that. 
You know, I think if people... but as far as like the long-term just like concept of storage. I don't think it's going anywhere really. Unless there’s this unforeseen shift in our society or something. You know, it just.

GM: That kind of leads me to my next question. The industry is now growing in Asia and worldwide. Why do you think that is? I mean there’s some obvious reason I could I say, but I’m curious what you think. 

AH: I think there’s just more...more consumerism more...their incomes are rising as well. So there’s, they have more discretionary spending and they're buying more stuff and it’s definitely I think related to consumerism. And valuing their things and having more more stuff and not as many places to put it. What are your thoughts on that? 

GM: I think it’s consumerism and population growth. An interesting thing in found was that in 
like in Europe total. There's like less than 3000 storage units for all of Europe in comparison to like over the 50k in the US. One of the explanations I saw was that it’s because land is more expensive there and less of it. But I also wonder if it’s symbolic of the different kind of value systems as well, like people Americans attachment to stuff and American consumerism. And how Asia has kind of been adopted a lot of that as well. So like they might be following suit because of what we're doing in a way. Like perhaps our symbolism of our middle class has been our stuff, you know, our things right? And so as things grow, more stuff grows
I think that may be the case but I think I have to look a little bit more and perhaps compare their consumer rates. 
AH: Yeah, that’s my thought too. Makes sense to me. 

GM: What factors influence the industry most? You mentioned people having to move, recession, economic. Is there anything else? Generational factors? 

AH: Like just in general? Like the drivers for the surge?

GM: Yeah. 

AH: The traditional saying is like the 4 Ds, or something like that, like death, divorce, dislocation, I don’t even know. I don’t buy into that so much because it’s...basically... all those things affect people moving, you know or relocating. So if you just say, you know, this is really about population growth and the driver is relocation because when people move....they often need storage one way or the other. That's like a big I think the biggest driver, you know college students, obviously, people who fall into that category because they’re technically moving around and relocating. Yeah, and then I don't think there's anything really beyond that that aside from just people's running out of space in their homes and buying stuff and they're not having room for it. Just like sentimental reasons people with a sentimental attachment to things so.
They put a value on their stuff. It's really important to them that they can keep it somewhere. Whether it’s like family members, those come from inheritance and things like that. Baby Boomers and the older generations, they’ve accumulated a lifetime of possessions. So when they pass away, death is kind of a driver on inheritance side because people they end up with their parents stuff and they either feel guilty getting rid of everything or they're waiting for some future date. They need a place to keep it, and that date maybe doesn’t come for a long time.
And then business, small business is another driver, just the growth. You can say even the growth of e-commerce and drop shipping businesses and things like that. I mean, you know storage is a very flexy, it’s month-to-month. You don't need to have to have a long-term lease. So, you know, as kind of online businesses grow and small businesses grow that also is s driver for storage too on the business side.  

GM: What are the most common and most surprising things that people put in storage units?

AH: Everything you can find in someone’s house. The vast amount of storage is furniture, clothes, business will store their inventory, you know, I get a lot of google alerts so I do know that people do store illegal items in storage, you know, and they stored contraband and things like that.

GM: How do they find that? Like how did they discover that? Do they get a check? 

AH: They get caught or something so after or there’s a warrant. A lot of times the manager discovers these things. They’re pretty good about trying to keep tabs on you know, they're not looking at what people are storing, but they are looking for suspicious behavior. Maybe people that are there too often or things like that or at weird times, might raise their suspicion if smell something or see something. They try to be very vigilant for the safety I guess of everyone around. It’s supposed to be secure private place where you store is kind of your thing, I mean...

GM: So they don’t scan it or anything when you put something through. It’s not like an Airport where they like put it through? 
AH: No, no ones really. You’re on camera probably.
But you know, that's just only watched if something, if there's a break in or something like that. And you know, you're in public view, I guess technically but no ones checking what you're putting in their necessarily. 

GM: Did you watch Breaking Bad by any chance? I think of him [Walt] breaking in the storage unit in a way. 

AH: Yeah, storing cash. Those things do get found. And it’s like your neighborhood, if you live in a neighborhood, you don’t know what your neighbors have in their house or garage. Storage is interesting like that. People need space to put all kinds of things. They have found like priceless items in storage like...comic books or weird things like that, that are worth like thousands of dollars. 

GM: You mean storage managers have found that? 

AH: Well, people buy the auctions. So when someone doesn’t pay they auction it off and the person that buys it sometimes finds like really valuable things. Like the show Storage Wars. I mean that's kind of a real thing, I mean it’s not common to find valuable things. You usually you're just selling but you can for what you, you know, trying to make your money back and you know, hopefully but sometimes extremely valuable things are put in there and forgotten.
Or football players, you know, like famous people they forget to pay their thing. So,.
I think Paris Hilton had an auction storage auction thing years ago. Football players, just different people. Someone else recently, ...Mark Wahlberg. It was all stuff from the 90s like his like movie poster like movie memorabilia and like things like that. 

GM: He didn’t claim it? 

AH: No, whoever was responsible for managing it must have forgotten to pay. I think they returned a few things to him. But the rest he was like “go ahead....”

GM: That's so funny! What do you think is that mindset of millennial customers versus the older ones when it comes to using storage unit? I think we kind of talked about it a bit, but I just want to make sure.

AH: I think millennials are a bit...What all the the storage operators, sophisticated storage operators want to capture, you know, they want to appeal to the millennial user so, you know, they're trying to make things more convenient. They’re trying to offer online rentals. If you can go, millennials are online so they’re tying to go where millennials are. They have nice webpages, and that’s what millennials are looking for. They’re looking for a facility where they can pull it up on their phone and they can enter their unit,  reserve their unit from their phone. I mean that's our company kind of steps in and makes it easy for consumers to shop and compare storage units online. Our company is a market place publication.
So that's important. And as far as facilities go, they are trying to make them nicer and more appealing, more comfortable. I have heard, I don't know, I haven’t confirmed it but kind of like building more smaller units, because millennials don’t have as much stuff but they have to store it. So maybe in some cities where there’s a lot of millennial customers. They are kind of building more five by five units and less 10 by 10 units, for example.
We did have one story on our news side about that. There's some evidence that that’s happening, but we’ll see if that happens more. If that becomes a real trend or if it’s an early early sign but that could be one way where you see that start to manifest.
But yeah, I think it is vitally important for your storage operators to reach millennials audience. And the idea that millennials have less stuff
And they're not attached material objects. I think in the last 2 years that's been kind of disproven and conceit that was...Maybe you know ten years old, or five or 10 years old and I think we’re starting to see that millennials are more like their predecessors in their buying habits as they age. So as they age they become they do become more like previous generations as far as consumerism and things like that. I think it's just been it's been more of a symptom of....you know, because as the recession there hasn't been a lot of income, or incomes as fallen so it’s harder to find, everybody has jobs but they’re, it’s not full employment necessarily. Or they live in an apartment, so they don't have a lot of disposable income.
In the same way that their parents did at their age, but now they're starting to get more disposable income. They're starting to behave the same way. So I think I don't think that's much of a worry.

GM: I was just kind of curious, how did you get into writing about the storage industry and if it used it as well? 

AH: By accident as well, it's pretty much, I was a business reporter, so general business reporter, journalism major and I was just looking for jobs around the country and there was this one. I was from Virginia originally looking for jobs in Austin. And then this is one of the jobs that is open, it was to report on Self Storage industry. And I was like that is pretty unique and interesting and so I applied and got the job. 
And prior to my move, I haven’t used since. I don’t have a unit now, but prior, I had a couple just in between moves back home. Kind of moving out of one place actually, it’s funny 
my wife now, when we were dating, she was living with someone but me and my wife want to get a place but that her roommate wanted to move in with us. They had been roommates for a long time. So we were like “actually, we don’t know what we’re going to do. We’re not going to move into a place right away, we were going to move back our hometown for like 3 months while we figure it out.” So we end up putting your stuff in storage for a couple months just so that we didn’t have to get a place with her roommate.

GM: (laughs) Just to avoid that awkward conversation? 

AH: Yeah, and then another time in between moves. But mostly like the college related kind of move, where you’re like off for summer so and between places and so when you’re
still figuring out… so… 

GM: I think that’s most of my questions. I just want to return to one of my previous questions. The aesthetics of a place. The original aesthetics of the storage units have like very similar right? Like that was kind of organically came together, but the new units you were saying are becoming more, like, they’re a little bit more thoughtful about how they’re fitting into the urban landscape or suburban landscape in order to even get approved and I kind of wonder if like if those aesthetics of the like the 70s that was more symbolic of, or representative rather of like that demographic that it was catering to do, do you know what I mean? And perhaps of those unit owners or maybe that age as well. Like I'm just kind of curious if that's why they all kind of look alike. They remind me of like toy houses. 

AH: So in the seventies and eighties, when the industry was first starting, they were kind of building on the outskirts of town. Now these new facilities want to be on the major highways and roads where they can be seen. So they’re building, like this almost advertisement. Originally, a lot of times back in the beginning of the industry. It was kind of like a land. Kind of like “I have this land one day. It might be developed into something. But for now, I'm just going to build a storage facility so I can make money. Until I can build houses on it or something” for example, so there wasn't really wasn't much thought really put into the construction. It was purely utilitarian and you know, just what needed to be what it needed to be to serve its purpose. But now, you know now they're building for aesthetic and for how do I get to build on next to the highway and capture people's attention? So I think then there just really has been much thought to it. It was just you know, how can we build it as cheaply as possible and have it serve its purpose?

GM: Okay, that makes sense. I was just fascinated, by how much, like even though they're owned by different companies, they all kind of looked alike initially. And I also find it fascinating that it's like even though it's like... I was comparing it, I see comparisons to like McDonalds and Starbucks. They all look alike because it's it’s a franchise, but storage unit industry is not really right, a small percentage of it is but yet they still kind of still follow that mode of aesthetics. 

AH: It’s just a trend that evolved over time. And a lot of the builders were the same builders, so they build for one person, but the construction builders themselves, they build for 10,
20 different people. So they do they build them all the same. Unless there’s a special request or something like that. And I think, one thing we didn’t touch on was the convergence of retail to self storage. 
So that’s another trend that you see is like Kmart and Walmart and even Target, all these big box stores. A lot of them closed down, Kmart and Sears have gone bankrupt, U-Haul bought a bunch of their their stores because they're converting these large retail stores into self- storage facilities.

GM: that’s for fascinating because it’s like literally people buy their stuff but they’re
moving into old big malls. They’re refilling it in some ways the stuff they would buy in there. 

AH: Yeah, they reuse the space, which is great, but yeah it’s really interesting because the internet has kind of killed that brick and mortar. Big box stores are not as 
sustainable as they are anymore. So a lot of them have closed. And people are all buying their stuff from Amazon.

GM: Yeah, that’s super fascinating to see. Like if I can find out like how many of these brick and mortars have closed in comparison to how many storage units have opened. That could be, perhaps a fascinating visualization.

AH: Yeah, that would be really good. And please share any research or visualizations you make. I’d love to look at them and if it’s possible to share them, we should. 

GM: Sure, we have been exploring this quantitatively and qualitatively, so I can share with you like the iterations I’ve just been kind of exploring. I haven't figured out just yet what the final visualization will be. We have to eventually like program it. So this week we are just focusing now on our paper. This is very helpful! Is it okay if I follow up with any questions?

AH: Yeah, definitely.

GM: Great, thank you so much!

AH: You’re welcome.
