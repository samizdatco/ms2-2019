      <h1>Self-Storage Nation</h1>

      <div class="intro">
  
        <p>For over four decades, the self-storage industry has catered to America’s material overflow. About 1 out of 10 Americans will use a self-storage facility at least one point in their lives. Providing an empty space for people’s private possessions the industry has served house and provided a mechanism to hold people’s stuff as they go through the various stages of life (death, divorce, dislocation, displacement, births, and college to name a few). 
Considering the current state of consumption and living, this thesis examines how the growth of the self-storage industry is representative of America’s consumer patterns, population growth, and migration trends.
