<b>One paragraph description: </b>
Catering to America’s material overflow, the self-storage industry has exploded into a booming $36 billion dollar market. Nearly 1 out of 10 American households currently rent a self storage unit and it’s continually growing. Visualizing survey data, this project examines how customers participate in this industry, revealing how self-storage is a window into America’s relationship to consumption.
