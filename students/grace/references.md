This book is a study on the new wandering tribe of america born out of the Great Recession and the growing ecnominc problems that most middle class face. Author, Jessica Bruder, covers a sect of people who had no intention of giving up their tradtional houses and apartments but fell behind after the Great Recesssion (Bruder’s nomads had lost their homes, jobs or both in the 2008 crash) to take the road by tens of thousands and essentially live in van, secondhand RV's, school buses, pickup campers, travel trailers, and what some call "wheel estate." The low-cost labor pool, made up largely of transient older Americans are being using by employers (most notably Amazon). Bruder takes time to get to know her subjects, accompanying them from job to job in this dark and what seems forgetton part of the American economy.
