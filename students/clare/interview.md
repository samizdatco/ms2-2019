“The class I taught [at Columbia University’s Teachers College] was called Museum Education Issues, I taught for about ten years…. You know my background is in education, I went to Steinhardt NYU and did a PhD in Education and I am interested in issues to do with child development….At Teachers College, my class was not so much about discussing topics related to inclusion, but  basically like looking at the museum as an educational institution.”
“In our second meeting I would to take the students to The Metropolitan Museum to explore galleries, often the Greek and Roman art galleries because there are materials there that a lot of people don’t know how to relate to and you must rely on labels and wall texts. So I asked my students to read the labels and see how/whether they could be improved. So at the end the course was an analysis of all these elements that we encounter in museums in terms of creating labels, creating wall text, and then from there we would explore issues related to education, such as creating lesson plans based on objects, public programs, etc. And because the course was a whole semester we would potentially get to envision a whole department; let’s say, if you are asked to take on the education department of a museum, what kind of things would you propose? And it was a good brainstorming for the students because most of them were very young, late 20s, early 30s, and they appreciated the exercise of thinking about how they could effect change. So I think there was an interest in opening up and making the museum less exclusive and accessible to a wider audience was the general idea.”
“It was very interesting to see 2 things, one was that my students were predominantly women….which makes me still think that there is a little bias in related to education and particularly museum education; that for the most part it is the work of women…. Also, because the setting was very international, we always addressed the role of the museum vis a vis specific communities."


"I came to The Bronx Museum in 2003 as the director of education, and I began to analyze what we have in our collection. Very quickly I realized a couple of things: first, that we does not have the so-called masterpieces, like Les Demoiselles d'Avignon or works by Goya or Rembrandt. From that I realized that we could not talk about art from that perspective of mastery, so that was one thing. And then the other thing was that the community was very diverse and for the most part working class, (the Bronx is one of the poorest districts in the US). So I realized that our approach would have to be more dialogical as opposed to what I had learnt before, which was based on the VTS. I don’t know if you are familiar with the Visual Thinking Strategies, have you read about that? I had been trained at The Metropolitan Museum with the rudiments of the VTS, which in a nutshell, is a formalist approach to engaging with the artwork. So you look at the composition and you say there is a big triangle and so, it is like those elements of art history watered down to a discussion with young people not familiar with art history in the gallery. So when I got to The Bronx Museum, I realized it didn’t make sense to do this formal kind of analysis based on history art and aesthetics because for the most part the works that we had in our collection were works that dealt with social issues. So based on these realizations I began to engage the education department into thinking how we could use the objects that we have in our collection not as fetishized objects of aesthetics but to engage; particularly because we were interested in working with young people, adolescents and even younger kids with the goal of empowering their voice, their own perspective. So we began to use art as a tool for critical thinking, language acquisition, and you know this kind of thing.”


“My critique about our profession is that we’re not doing a show for our friends; we are doing shows for whoever comes to the museum, so we should not just be talking to our friends. But I think that is so ingrained, and I think that it’s kind of funny….but I don’t like to see myself as a curator, I find it a very silly label now because people talk about curators for wine, for shoes or whatever. And I go back to the beginning of our conversation, that I feel that the work to be done in museums-- with museums, for museums--has to be based in education. If we are going to address equality you cannot just give equality, it’s kind of pathetic to think in those terms. You have to create conditions to awake in people’s minds the possibility of that happening. Because at the end equality, freedom, equity cannot be given, it has to be earned, and I think that is the work in education.”

Interview with Liam Sweeney, March 15 - approved quote:


"Talking about representational diversity is really important because it hasn’t been solved. Representational diversity is the demographic composition of a certain population, and representational diversity can be quantified….It’s important to understand that representational diversity has a part to play because you can’t even hope to talk about equitable power structures if you have a homogenous environment that’s homogeneously privileged… Inclusion has to do with the atmosphere of a place so that people feel welcome. It’s so important to talk about the climate of these institutions, and how to interact with audiences, how to design workspaces… I think that it’s a crucial conversation. Equity is really about how power operates, about who has a seat at the table, how people advance through institutions, whether there are tacit rules or barriers… it’s a more intractable problem."
