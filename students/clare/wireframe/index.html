        <p>New York City-funded museums and national art museums.</p>
        <p>There are 2,620 art museums across the US, according to the Institute of Museum and Library Services 2018 data files. Who visits these museums and who works there? <br>
      <p style="color:#a7ccf1">  What's in the data? </p><p>Using publicly available datasets from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) audience data, reported findings from two national art museum staff surveys 
        and New York Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) grantee staff survey dataset, these visualizations dig into particular findings.</p>
        <p>By looking at museum audience demographics, and who the curatorial and leadership staff are, and the artwork collection datasets, 
        information and trends appear. This project aims to look at details in light of larger conversations around contemporary art museums.</p>
        <p>Availability of open data limits possible findings to inferences, however by bringing together related sets of information, 
        the aim is to create a richer sense of demographics, who is doing what, and, to an extent, what is changing.</p>

          <p>National demographics change as our population changes. Over the past five years, does our national 
          population reflect our local New York City one?<br> And of our population, who has been going to our art museums?</p>

         &nbsp;
          <p>Which leads us to the question, since these charts show disparities between audiences and population, who is working in the museums?</p>

      <h2 class="who">Staff</h2><h2>Who are New York City's publicly funded 'museum' staff - from board to each job type?</h2>
      
         <main id="#mainfull">
         <p class="starter">A grantee staff survey, developed out of a similar effort to measure the diversity of staff working in US museums conducted the previous year, 
          was commissioned in 2015 by New York City. As the resulting 2016 report rightly pointed out, this is a cautious investigation since, 
          “Quantifying diversity in labor markets is an inherently fraught pursuit, in part because our techniques 
          for recording this data, our nomenclature, our definitions must be necessarily blunt in order to reduce the richness of characteristics we use to categorize ourselves 
          and others (race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, to name only a few) into discrete categories." These charts here are likewise cautiously drawn.</p>
          <p class="starter">In order to approximate museums similar to those on the city's Cultural Institutions Group, those classified as museums that have budgets of $999,999+ (in order to select what may 
          more typically be thought of as a museum with collections of works, a building and staff who look after the collection) are depicted.<br>
          The NYC DCLA publicly available dataset, with the "Diversity in the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs Community" 
          survey findings from Ithaka S+R and funding partner, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, had a big impact on the city’s cultural community. </p>
        <p class="starter">Following the report, the DCLA initiated a cultural plan, reaching out to “nearly 200,000 New York City residents, from 
        every corner of the city,” to hear priorities, concerns, and ideas from local residents. In July 2017, CreateNYC Plan for the city’s five boroughs, was 
        released. One of the unusual actions initiated was to tie funding to diversity plans, “DCLA will introduce new diversity measures for our city's cultural organizations including 
        collecting data from grantees about the diversity of staff and board members; asking for organizations' approaches to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI); and in FY 2019 will 
        require DEI plans from the Cultural Institutions Group - 33 members whose institutions are on city-owned property. They receive significant capital and operating support from 
        NYC to help meet basic security, maintenance, administration and energy costs. In return for this support, these institutions operate as publicly-owned facilities whose mandate is to 
        provide cultural services accessible to all New Yorkers.</p>

        <p>Is it possible to follow curators hiring trends in the past few years? This visualization uses the NYC DCLA grantee staff survey, filtered for employed curators at museums with budgets 
        over $999,999, 7,647 museum employees with 312 curators. Each line shows all curators (left) filtered by those hired in the period 2010 - 2015 (the survey went to the field in 2015.) 
        The NYC DCLA survey codebook lists the following race/ethnicities:<br>
1 American Indian or Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander<br> 
2 Asian<br> 
3 Black or African American <br>
4 Hispanic <br>
5 Two Or More Races<br>

        responses from 332 art museums, including 136 AAMD institutions that participated in the 2015 survey. Visualizations here are from the report, the datasets

          Results from surveys like the 2018 national art museums survey
          compared to the previous 2015 one that allow us to ask specific questions about the composition of the field, what are the trends at the senior position?  </p>
          <p>More recent hiring at NYC DCLA Museums has seen an increase of Black/African American staff, is this for all positions? What are the recent hiring trends? NYC DCLA museum curators are mainly white non-Hispanic, but recent hiring has seen an increase in representational diversity for curators and those working
          in museum education but this is not evident for more senior positions.</p>

      <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
      <section class="discussion">
        <p>--somewhat placeholder text ----Who can continue to change museums and in what direction?
        Looking at representational diversity here is only a part of the conversation about museums. What it does indicate is that museums are not equitable. 
      <br>
      Does the model of the art museum with power at the top a model that needs to be rethought? And if so, by whom, those in these institutions or by those 
      who are not at present included in art museums? <br>
      NYC DCLA initiated an interesting funding requirement with the DEI plan. Initiatives, social inclusion, activities to promote museums as social hubs and communities are growing. 
      Most importantly, there are funding efforts to 
      support paid fellowships, paid internships, training, and mentoring of staff to help open these positions to everyone. And there are ongoing 
      school education programs to bring young people into museums as a part of their everyday experience.<br>
    
      And critically, what do people who are excluded, the majority who do not visit their local art museum, envisage? If the local museum was their space, all our spaces,
      a place that we all equally owned, what do we want to change?   </p>
