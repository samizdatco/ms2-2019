Subject: contemporary art and art museums


1) 	Topic: 	I am studying the representation of artworks by women artists in NYC art museums

	Question: 
			- Because I want to find out what the percentage of artworks by women is compared to artworks by men 
			- Because I want to find out whether these percentages are the same across NYC museums, e.g. MoMA, Whitney, Guggenheim NY, The Met Modern & Contemporary Art Collection, Brooklyn Museum's Contemporary Art Collection and Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art Collection, Studio Museum in Harlem
			- Because I want to find out whether these percentages are changing over time
			- Because I want to compare NYC art museums with other similar US art museums (e.g. MOCA, SFMOMA, CMA, MFAH)
			- Because I want to compare NYC art museums with similar international art museums (e.g. Hamburger Bahnhof, MOCA Shanghai, Tate)
			 
	Significance: In order to help readers understand what the percentage of artworks by gender in NYC art museums are, how NYC museums compare with each other, and how they compare with select national and international museums.
