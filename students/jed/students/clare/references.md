Nochlin, Linda. *Women, Art, and Power: And Other Essays.* New York: Harper & Row, 1988.

N72.F45 N64 1988 

[Call Number from Bobst library catalog]

Art historian Linda Nochlin has had a huge impact, as she herself noted, “When I embarked on 'Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?' in 1970, there was no such thing as a feminist art history: like all other forms of historical discourse, it had to be constructed.”  Upto that point, the accepted view of Western art had mostly been from a white, male point of view, whether acknowledged or not. 
In this book, Nochlin has compiled essays that she wrote over nearly 20 years, starting with the most recent, titled, 'Women, Art, and Power' (and ending with the infamous essay, 'Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?')
In several of the essays, Nochlin examines the work of specific artists who are women through particular artworks that she discusses in detail. She connects these with the larger theoretical, social construct, in particular, power structures in society and how these impact the visual art world and artists who are women in particular.
Nochlin stresses that she was coming from the viewpoint not of a supplement to mainstream art history, but “At it’s strongest, a feminist art history is a transgressive and anti-establishment practice, meant to call many of the major precepts of the discipline into question.”  The heart of the problem, she argues, is the institutional framework not the individual. Conditions generally productive of 'great' art need to be investigated but rarely are - she notes the range of the social and institutional structures surrounding art production, such as social class, relatives who are professional artists, training, apprenticeship and education, patriarchy, and systems of patronage, and how these structures marginalize certain kinds of artistic production and limit achievement for some classes and groups.

### Questions
1. Is this essay ('Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?') the most ground-breaking text to drive recent feminist art history?
2. The latest essay here is 1988, have theoretical texts on women and visual arts changed in the last 30+ years?
3. Did Nochlin look at this issue from a statistical point of view and count numbers represented?

Reilly, Maura. *Curatorial Activism: Towards an Ethics of Curating.*  London: Thames & Hudson, 2018.

[Call Number from Bobst library catalog]

N72.S6 R444 2018 

'Curatorial Activism: Towards an Ethics of Curating' is written by Maura Reilly who is the founding curator (2007) of the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at Brooklyn Museum. In the book, she discusses strategies that she says embody curatorial activism and gives a historical overview identifying group exhibitions for each of these by earliest date (1976) and describes each exhibition. An interesting component included here are some of the critical media reactions to each show. 
The book is grouped into chapters that focus on sexism, white privilege, and heterocentrism. While the book examines examples of ground-breaking shows that have demonstrated that new approaches are possible, the last chapter lays out that there are huge inequities despite these exhibitions, and Reilly puts forward strategies for change for gender and racial equality in the art world.

### Questions

1. Is Maura Reilly a good person to interview because of her knowledge of this space and her inclusion of stats throughout the book? 
2. Would she have suggestions of which museum / other numbers to access - what gaps there are that I could usefully pursue?
3. I am potentially interested in Brooklyn Museum's collection - but don't see gender identified as a column heading in their API - why not?

Robinson, Hilary, ed. *Feminism-Art-Theory: An Anthology 1968-2000.*
Oxford, UK; Malden, Mass.: Blackwell Publishers, 2001.

[Call Number from Bobst library catalog]

N72.F45 F442 2001

Hilary Robinson, a UK professor, has edited a comprehensive book on a large number (99) of feminist texts. She specifically does not include some more widely known essays (e.g. Linda Nochlin's, 'Why Have there Been no Great Women Artists?') but collates less known essays by primarily US and UK writers from a diverse range of sources. The essays are grouped in 9 themes, and span over 30 years of writing on art and the women's movement. The book shows just how many people have been writing about feminism and what a range of people were, and are, involved, the sheer plurality of feminism. Robinson notes that feminism is a political struggle, in this instance, against the patriarchy of the art world.

(There is a second version of this anthology (to 2014) which is checked out of Bobst library at present.)

### Questions

1. Is the strategy of not including some of the more widely circulated texts useful here or does this slightly limit the notion of the 'anthology?'
2. Would some kind of map indicating the lines that join writers to each other, those that were in the same location for instance or in the same feminist groups, or that were in shows together, add to an understanding of this narrative?
3. How did you decide what to include, what to leave out, and what to group into the 9 sections you define?

Hayden, Malin H., and Sjöholm, Jessica, eds. *Feminisms is Still Our Name: Seven Essays on Historiography and Curatorial Practices.* Newcastle upon Tyne, UK: Cambridge Scholars Publishing. 2010.

[Call Number from Bobst library catalog]

N72.F45 F46 2010

'Feminisms is Still Our Name,' published 2010, is an anthology of seven essays by leading writers in the field about feminism in visual art and approaches to feminism. The plural title is appropo here. The editors note that thinking and acting by way of dichotomies is limited in an era of identities. It is noted that feminisms have played a crucial part in art, art history and curatorial practices over the last forty years, and so it is important to look closely at the history of feminist theories within these fields. 
The essays take stock of feminist practices now, and debate recent exhibitions and discuss ways forward, lay out different strategies, and discuss art history and curatorial practices. One compelling essay is by Griselda Pollock, 'Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space, and the Archive.' 
One of the editors, Malin H. Hayden critiques the 2007 'Global Feminisms' show at the Brooklyn Museum arguing that it connected together women's art and feminism by only exhibiting art by women in the show.

### Questions

1. This highlights a division between art by women and feminist art (by any gender(s)) - raises a question for me about whether this project is about art made by men and art made by women?
2. And very relatedly, if I highlight % by 2 genders, is this about feminism at all? Is research into feminism and feminist art not the right strategy? Would it be better to try and identify a plurality of genders, is the women / men divide not appropriate any more?
3. Would looking at contemporary curatorial practices be a better avenue for research?

Vikram, Anuradha. *Decolonizing Culture: Essays on the Intersection of Art and Politics.* San Francisco, CA: Art Practical Books. 2017.

[Call Number from Bobst library catalog]

N72.P6 V55 2017

'Decolonizing Culture: Essays on the Intersection of Art and Politics' is a collection of 17 essays by Anuradha Vikram on specific exhibitions through which she discusses race and gender parity in the art world. They were written 2013-2017 for a regular online column and address issues in contexts that show that art and culture can not be separated from the "social, political, and economic circumstances under which they are produced and exhibited." (Bean Gilsdorf, ed in chief, *Daily Serving.*) She examines, for instance, Kara Walker's public art project, 2014, at the Domino Sugar Factory in Brooklyn., p37, and talks about (p44) Micol Hebron's show of 300 posters by different artists illustrating the gender ratios at top NY and LA galleries. The essays tend to focus on controversial shows or elements within shows and deconstruct the meanings and highlight the issues they display.
"As Sturtevants's work so deftly makes clear, economic circumstances also determines whose work is deemed significant to history. As yet, no similar assessment has been made of ethnic diversity among artists represented in galleries or museums. This would seem a logical next step and one that I intend to help initiate down the line." 
As Michelle Carlson notes in the afterword, “Art cannot be separated from the bodies that make it.”

### Questions
1. Am I being too narrow by only looking at gender (artists who are women, artists who are men)
2. Wondering a logical thing to do is to contact the author (Vikram would be a great person to interview) and ask about  the 'logical next step' - if I took a category say in MoMA's collection, would it be nationality or place of birth for instance, and would that define ethnicity?
3. “Art cannot be separated from the bodies that make it.” - great quote - basis for my research perhaps?

Ter Horst, Mariska, ed. *Changing Perspectives: Dealing with Globalisation in the Presentation and Collection of Contemporary Art.* Amsterdam: KIT Publishers. 2012.

[Call Number from Bobst library catalog]

N72.P6 V55 2017

The book arises out of a symposium, 'Collecting Without Borders,' 2009, in the Netherlands and comprises of 20 essays around art and globalization.
Essays by curators from a range of museums talk about curatorial practices within the context of institutions. The writers investigate ways art museums can maintain their relevance within shifting contexts, and in specific instances, in relation to Danish art museums.
Writers ask the question, what is the role of museums in a multicultural and globalizing community? 
Steven ten Thije writes (p11) that the Van Abbe [Museum] "realized that the question of inclusion and exclusion had no meaning unless the institution of the museum itself, in its Western form, is subjected to fundamental reappraisal."
