## Bruder, Jessica. Nomadland: _Surviving America in the Twenty-first Century_. Waterville: Thorndike Press, A Part of Gale, a Cengage Company, 2018.

HD6280 .B77 2017

 
This book is a study on the new wandering tribe of America born out of the Great Recession and the growing economic problems that most middle-class face. Author, Jessica Bruder, covers a sect of people who had no intention of giving up their traditional houses and apartments but fell behind after the Great Recession (Bruder’s nomads had lost their homes, jobs or both in the 2008 crash) to take the road by tens of thousands and essentially live in van, secondhand RV's, school buses, pickup campers, travel trailers, and what some call "wheel estate." The low-cost labor pool made up largely of transient older Americans are being using by employers (most notably Amazon). Bruder takes time to get to know her subjects, accompanying them from job to job in this dark and what seems forgotten part of the American economy and lays the case of what could very well be the fate of a lot more Americans.

## Coleman, Joseph. _Unfinished Work the Struggle to Build an Aging American Workforce._ New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2015.

HD6280 .C555 2015

Author, Joseph Coleman, addresses the aging workforce as a global issue, with particular focus on the U.S. Citing financial reasons as the main cause of longer work spans, he notes that in the United States as the private pension system is fading, people have less guaranteed money at retirement. In addition, and at the same time, unemployment can hit workers in their 50s, just as they are juggling mortgages, car loans and their children’s college bills, forcing them to burn through their savings. Through a series of reconstructed interviews, personal experience, examination of government documents, archival materials, and/or news footage he shows how the fast the elderly poverty is growing and how companies are struggling to adjust to the changing capabilities and needs of their workers. He notes how people need to be saving more but are failing to do so. However, he advocates that our country should prepare and help transition the aging workface. He poses this through policies and funding that will help retain mid- and late-career, encouraging companies to adjust the aging work class, and update the retirement system so that people are not penalized to retire early, but make it more comfortable and profitable for them to keep working. Most importantly, he argues that at the very least the “government should have a coherent, clear-eyed, and humane policy toward older workers, one that encourages companies to capitalize on older workers’ values and allows the workers themselves greater freedom to exercise their talents and capabilities. Societies themselves will have to figure out ways of doing that based on local circumstances and needs.” Essentially this book is a sample of how some of the various work polices are being played out today.

### Questions

1. The author illustrates the global aging workface through personal profiles around the world (Japan, France, Sweden, U.S.), however, I’m curious at looking at statistical data of what industries and skills are valued there how they compare and contrast?

2. The problems for the aging work-class seem to stack high when this book was written in 2015, how do they fair now in the growing use of automated jobs? What happens when those skill-sets that they had are now replaced with ai?

3. What are the industries that people aged out the fastest? Which industries value the aging working class?

## Sørensen, Ninna Nyberg, and Karen Fog Olwig. _Work and Migration: Life and Livelihoods in a Globalizing World._ London: Routledge, 2010.

HD6300 .W67 2002


This book is a more of an anthropological rather than economic observation of viewing migration on a global scale. Through a number of case studies of local people from around the globe who have moved nationally or internally within their own country, contributing authors give a wider perspective on what why people migrate and what it means to making a living while on the move. She notes that “mobile populations do not necessarily migrate to start a new life elsewhere, but rather to search out new opportunities that may allow them to enhance and diversify livelihoods practiced back home." Analyzing the mobile livelihoods that have emanated from the Caribbean, Latin America and East Africa and expanded to North America, Europe and Asia, she presents a wider landscape of the multiple flows of lives and skills through migrating to work. 
The research departs from delving into the studies of livelihood practices, and instead examines the various forms of livelihoods as practiced and, conceived, by specific social actors in particular ethnographic and historical contexts, and the local, regional and more distant spheres of activities that these livelihoods imply. 
The book argues that studying movement from the point of view of mobile livelihoods that “both define and cut across a range of social, economic and cultural boundaries, it is possible to explore critically the topical units and forms of movement that may be of relevance in migratory movements.”

2. How do outside influences like global market, crime affect the migration? 
3. What types of work do migrant jobs usually fill?

## Thompson, Gabriel. _Working in the Shadows: A Year Doing the Jobs (most) Americans Wont Do._ New York: Nation Books, 2011.

HD6300 .T46 2010

This book is Gabriel Thompson’s first-hand account of what it is like to work with undocumented immigrant workers of Latino in various labor-intensive industries. In detail and through first hand experiences, he reveals the challenges and struggles that these low-paid workers face. Experiencing the work himself and concealing his identity to gain access, he gives an emphatic glimpse of the toll that these physical and mental intensive jobs take, how little pay they make and how they can be often degrading. I think his aim to leave readers aware of the inherent social and political consequences of America’s low-wage workforce. In his conclusion, Thompson argues for labor and immigration reform.

## Piepmeier, Alison. _Girl Zines: Making Media, Doing Feminism._ New York: New York University Press, 2009.

PN4836 .P54 2009

This book is on the few books I could find that takes a serious look at zines and how’s it is a vehicle for feminism today. Focusing on the feminism’s third wave, Piepmeier takes a look at zines like The East Village Inky, Mend My Dress, and Dear Stepdad that are crafted by girls and women in the decades in the 90s and 2000s. She argues how these zines are representative of feminism’s third wave. The documents the style of zines (messy, photocopied do-it-yourself documents cover every imaginable subject matter and are loaded with handwriting, collage art, stickers, and glitter) and how they all reflect the personal style of the creators. The zines have become platforms for women to construct and shape their own narratives, identities, and communities.  
Piepmeier argues zines can give a complex window in the future of feminism and how zines seems to “instigate a kind of gift culture: little eddies of artifacts accrues around grrl zines.” She poses that zines “instigate intimate, affectionate connections between their creators and readers.”
