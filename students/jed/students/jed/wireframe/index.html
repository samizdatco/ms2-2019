      <h1>A Visual Exploration of the American Archive for Public Broadcasting</h1>

      <div class="intro">
        <p>What is the AAPB</p>
        <p>The American Archive of Public Broadcasting seeks to preserve and make accessible significant historical content created by public media, and to coordinate a national effort to save at-risk public media before its content is lost to posterity.</p>

        <p>In April 2013, CPB selected WGBH and the Library of Congress as the permanent stewards of the American Archive project and provided funding for an initial two-year period to complete the digitization project, ingest digital files, create a website for stations and the public, and develop plans for access, growth, and sustainability. Agreements between the parties involved were signed in August and September of 2013. WGBH and the Library chose “The American Archive of Public Broadcasting,” abbreviated as “AAPB,” for the program’s official name.</p>

<p>WGBH and the Library share governance responsibilities. WGBH is responsible for overseeing the completion of the digitization project; the development of the AAPB website to provide the public with access to the more than 2.5 million inventory records and as many of the digital files as possible, rights permitting; and station relations. The Library will ingest files into its Packard Campus Digital Archive and maintain the integrity of the AAPB digitized content in perpetuity. All 40,000 hours of digitized material will be available for on-site viewing and listening at WGBH and the Library of Congress.</p>

<p>Together, WGBH and the Library of Congress have developed plans to grow the collection by enhancing existing metadata records, targeting and adding new records from stations and other institutions with at risk public broadcasting materials, and targeting and adding new digital files. By October 2015, WGBH and the Library plan to open an online reading room on the AAPB website, restricted to research, educational and informational uses, with content made available for streaming for which permissions has been obtained or which may prudently be presented for research, educational and informational purposes under fair use and other legal doctrines. The two organizations plan to create curated presentations, develop educational outreach programs, and pursue grants to sustain AAPB for the long term.</p>

<p>WGBH and the Library believe that the legacy of American public broadcasting must be preserved for future generations. We will continue to be helped in this effort by lessons learned from those involved in earlier initiatives to preserve public broadcasting materials. We look forward to collaborating with others in this effort to keep, organize, and provide access to the cultural treasures created by the public media system.</p>

      <h2>The Bicycle Network</h2>

          <p>In 1949, the National Association of Educational Broadcasters began the program exchange using magnetic tape recordings which was later called “the bicycle network.” Station WNYC, New York City, made five sets of recordings of the 1949 Herald Tribune Forum which were distributed to and aired by twenty-two NAEB member stations.</p>


<p>By 1950 the “bicycle network” had advanced to the point where several stations agreed to exchange programs by tape recording. Seymour Siegel, Director of WNYC, recorded several programs from the New York area for distribution, and the Association received a gift of tape from the Cooper Union for use in the project.</p>

<p>By May, Siegel was able to report that the “network which is enjoying enormous growth, will soon be able to furnish four hours of programs per day to member stations, and will include selected programs from BBC and CBS as well as excellent offerings from member stations and institutions.” This operation, though considered to be a function of the NAEB, was actually carried out by Siegel and, his WNYC staff with little outside assistance or financial aid.</p>
