## Soley, Lawrence C. Free Radio: Electronic Civil Disobedience. Boulder, Colo: Westview Press, 1999.

HE 8697 .65 .U6 S65 1999

A comprehensive history of "free" radio -- what are also known as "pirate" radio stations -- beginning in pre-WWII Europe through the 1990s in the US. The content is decidedly pre-internet due to publishing date, but rooted directly in the government issued policies of broadcasting.

"Free Radio presents compelling evidence that unlicensed radio stations in the United States—which number in the hundreds—are a response to changes in federal broadcasting policies. The policy changes have led to the domination of the medium by a few large corporations that use their stations to promote their financial and political interests, rather than the interests of the communities they are supposed to serve." -GoogleBooks blurb

## Peters, Kimberley. Sound, Space and Society: Rebel Radio. London: Palgrave Macmillan., 2018.

HE 8697 .6 .P48 2018

~Good neighbor~ 

A United Kingdom and meritime-centric view on pirate radio; particularly rooted around the study of Radio Caroline, broadcasting from international waters beginning in the 1960s. Peters work focuses on the spaciality of radio as a media form, and the geopolitics of broadcasting from sea-based locales. Due to publication date in 2017/2018, the references within look to be promising for exploring relevant works through the 2000s picking up from where _Free Radio_ (above) leaves off in its research.


"In 1964, rebel radio stations took to the seas in converted ships to offer listening choice to a young, resistant audience, against a backdrop of restrictive broadcasting policies. This book draws on this exceptional moment in social history, and the decades that followed, teasing out the relations between sound, society and space that were central to ‘pirate’ broadcasting activities. With a turn towards mediated life in geography, studies of radio have been largely absent. However, radio remains the most pervasive mass communications medium. 
This book breaks new ground, discussing in depth the relationship between radio, space and society; considering how space matters in the production, consumption and regulation of audio transmission, through the geophysical spaces of sea, land and air."" -Publisher description

### Questions
1. What useful precedents have been set by Radio Caroline and how have they informed other offshore pirate radio stations (and independent web radio)?
2. How do geospatial political questions surrounding location of origin for radio broadcast translate to a global listenership of an internet radio station (commercial or independent?) How is a network different from an ocean? 
3. "Intimate soundscapes, it will be contended, were forged by the sound-space-society relations unique to the pirate radio enterprise." (from the Introduction) --- per the above, how are these relations unique?

## Hughes, Diane, Mark Evans, Guy Morrow, and Sarah Keith. The New Music Industries: Disruption and Discovery. Cham, Switzerland: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016.

ML 3790 .H84 2016

There are a few interests that brought me to this book:
	- how does music function as modern day 'muzak' in corporate/capitalist and public spaces, and what are the protocols for distribution and selection? 
	- is AI going to take over this space immediately, or what? are humans required to program music for 'public' spaces in order for the environment to be aesthetically and commercially successful?
	- how are streaming giants (spotify, apple, tidal, etc) engaging in this market?

I don't believe this book is exactly what I'm looking for to begin to answer those questions, and is instead focused on new distribution models for artists and music labels as of the publish date of 2016. Potentially worthwhile alternative research works may be referenced within. Also a skim of the index has me interested in the concept of 'hard vs soft creativity' which appears to be discussed throughout -- a concept heretofore unknown to me. 

"This research-based book outlines career models for artists, methods of creative engagement, artistic options including individuality and branding, production practices, the realities of being a musician in the new industries, and implications for popular music education. Due to the profound effects of the digitisation of music, the music industries have undergone rapid transformation. The former record label dominated industry has been supplanted by new industries, including digital aggregators, strategists and online platforms. These new music industries now facilitate ‘direct’ access to both artists and their music. While such accessibility and the potential for artist exposure have never been greater, the challenge to stand out or to even navigate a musical career pathway is formidable. A useful resource for musicians and educators, this text highlights the ways in which the new music industries facilitate increased opportunities for 21st Century popular musicians to collaborate, communicate and interact with others interested in their music."

### Questions
1. What distribution approach is this study advocating for?
2. Is Palgrave>Pivot a well-regarded source for research? 
3. In order to answer the questions listed above --- what would be the better search terms? Music in public/commercial spaces? This book appears to be more about social media strategies and fostering artistic creativity than disruption of current models.
4. What would be interesting resources for analyzing popular music charts over time (Billboard, etc)

## Kernfeld, Barry Dean. Pop Song Piracy: Disobedient Music Distribution since 1929. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2011.

ML 3790 K.448 2011

~Good neighbor~

Kernfield's study of various methods of the distribution of popular music by illegal/corrupt means hues near to my interest of pirate radio -- with an expanded section (part II) dedicated to the practice of pirate radio in northwestern Europe. A theme throughout the work appears to be the analysis of methods of copying -- from duplicating song sheets and sheet music in the late 1920s to copying of tapes and compact discs in the 1990s. The book appears to conclude in the Napster era of peer to peer media sharing of the mid 2000s. 

"In the 1940s and ’50s, Kernfeld reveals, song sheets were succeeded by fake books, unofficial volumes of melodies and lyrics for popular songs that were a key tool for musicians. Music publishers attempted to wipe out fake books, but after their efforts proved unsuccessful they published their own. Pop Song Piracy shows that this pattern of disobedience, prohibition, and assimilation recurred in each conflict over unauthorized music distribution, from European pirate radio stations to bootlegged live shows. Beneath this pattern, Kernfeld argues, there exists a complex give and take between distribution methods that merely copy existing songs (such as counterfeit CDs) and ones that transform songs into new products (such as file sharing). Ultimately, he contends, it was the music industry’s persistent lagging behind in creating innovative products that led to the very piracy it sought to eliminate."

### Questions
1. How does Kernfield's survey of pirate radio broadcasting in Europe differ or relate to the works referenced above --- how in depth on this subject does the author go? Skimming the chapter it appears to be a brief summary on the effects of radio in various regions. Can the sources referenced provide additional helpful context on this topic?
2. Does an archive exist for stolen music? Where are the original fakebooks and replicated song sheets today? Can the distribution be mapped?
3. What would a history of bootlegging (of all various means and media) look like?

## Terkel, Studs. American Dreams: Lost and Found. New York: New Press, 2010.

CT 220 .T42 1990z

Studs Terkel was a prolific author and historian, best known for documenting the people's stories via oral history. This collection focuses specifically on American stories -- from the perspective of the very well known few to the common person. I felt that these stories might resonate particularly in our current political moment. My original thinking was that it would be great to take all of the available Studs Terkel audio recordings available, create an archive, and do a voice-to-text analysis of every available clip and then put them on a map. I then found out that the Studs Terkel based at WFMT in Chicago is already working on all of this (and more) -- which is great, but dashed my hopes for further exploring this project. However the stories remain and I expect could spark research in a new direction.

"In this unique look at one of our most pervasive national myths, Studs Terkel persuades an extraordinary range of Americans to articulate their version of “The American Dream.” Beginning with an embittered winner of the Miss U.S.A. contest who sees the con behind the dream of success and including an early interview with a highly ambitious Arnold Schwarzenegger, Terkel explores the diverse landscape of the promise of the United States—from farm kids dreaming of the city to city kids determined to get out, from the Boston Brahmin to the KKK member, from newly arrived immigrants to families who have lived in this country for generations, these narratives include figures both famous and infamous. Filtered through the lens of our leading oral historian, the chorus of voices in American Dreams highlights the hopes and struggles of coming to and living in the United States. Originally published in 1980, this is a classic work of oral history that provides an extraordinary and moving picture of everyday American lives."

### Questions
1. What would a textual analysis on these stories collected thematically reveal if mapped by geography or common language?
2. Choosing a specific subject from the collection, where would a geneology (of family, of related events) lead in research into contemporary times?
3. An index doesn't exist for this edition -- how could a visual index be created as a project of exploration through the text? Are there examples of visualized indices to reference?

## Remnick, David. Life Stories: Profiles from "The New Yorker". New York: Random House, 2000.

CT 220 .L54 2000

~Good neighbor~

A collection of profiles from the New Yorker magazine, this book appeared as a good neighbor to the Terkel oral history. Both of these books appealed to me because of their 'compilation' type of approach to content. I immediately read the profile of the late magician, Ricky Jay, by Mark Singer from 1993 and was totally compelled. There were many references within that single article that had my mind racing in several tangential directions for potential research. The indulgence this book provides is that each of the people written about here would present the same opportunity for the discovery of new threads to pull on. 

"One of art’s purest challenges is to translate a human being into words. The New Yorker has met this challenge more successfully and more originally than any other modern American journal. It has indelibly shaped the genre known as the Profile. Starting with light-fantastic evocations of glamorous and idiosyncratic figures of the twenties and thirties, such as Henry Luce and Isadora Duncan, and continuing to the present, with complex pictures of such contemporaries as Mikhail Baryshnikov and Richard Pryor, this collection of New Yorker Profiles presents readers with a portrait gallery of some of the most prominent figures of the twentieth century. These Profiles are literary-journalistic investigations into character and accomplishment, motive and madness, beauty and ugliness, and are unrivalled in their range, their variety of style, and their embrace of humanity."

### Questions
1. What happened to Ricky Jay's extensive collection of rare books, prints, playbills, oddities? What is the provenance of these objects and what action was determined to do with his estate? Brief research online does not yield answers on this.
2. Could a six-degrees of separation analysis be performed on the individuals who are profiled in this book? What surprising connections might be found?
3. What other revelations could be determined via textual analysis of this collection? What other roads of inquiry might be sparked by the other profiles?
