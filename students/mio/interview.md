##Interview with Jeanette Miranda, Software Test Engineer, SpaceX
###Disclaimer
Because call was recorded, she disclosed last minute that she didn't feel comfortable/didn't think SpaceX would be happy if she answered questions pertaining to her workplace, especially if it would portray it in a negative light. I proceeded with the interview, asking her questions pertaining to college, general problems of sexism in STEM fields, and outreach initiatives. I am actively looking for other sources who would be willing to share conditions in the industry on an anonymized basis.

###Interview Transcript
This call is now being recorded. 

Did you get that message? Okay. Okay, sorry. I'm going to run through the questions. Feel free to tell me about your experience as, you know, like as a stem major specifically in engineering and computer science in college. If you could just tell me about your experience specifically related to the gender make up and such. 

I really loved being a stem major in college. I think from very early on I had always been interested in creating things and understanding why things work the way they did and enjoyed math and was lucky enough to be surrounded by many people when I was younger. Who encouraged that in me regardless of gender. Um, I think things did change a little bit for me in college and the further into stem I got, the more apparent it became that I was in the minority because of my gender. Most of the time I would say I didn't notice it, especially when I was around a group of people or a class or a team that I was very comfortable with. But there would be occasional moments if I walked into a classroom and I was one of four females in a class of 30. It's kind of hard not to see that. 

Definitely I've been in those situations, but your experience was overall positive? 

I would say yes. I think the attitude I tried to bring to it was, I had skills that perhaps are considered more stereotypically female that actually ended up being a really strong advantage in the sciences. And then that if you created a team of people with strong skills but also maybe with some of those female skills the entire project and team was able to do better. 

And so to try to clarify, I was just wondering what sort of skills you were talking about?

I think teamwork and style of teamwork is one of them that comes to mind. I worked around a lot of awesome people and I found that in college on group projects and such when we did best was when we were able to effectively work together. I would say reading people is useful to some degree. I'm by no means an expert on this. Like I am an engineer at heart and am very rational, logical. But reading people in the present. I kind of can do that and understand, understand when to push and when to back off. And the people are people I think were really valuable. I think this one is maybe less tied to gender for me, but the creativity problem of, maybe the solution isn't always to try to solve the problem in front of you. Maybe the solution is to figure out how to avoid solving that problem entirely is very valued. This is engineering. 

Hmm. Were there any difficulties at all that you encountered during your time at Brown? Like, you know, in classes or car team or related things.

My experience I think tended to be much more that I have put limits on myself for reasons that trace back to childhood more so than ever. Realizing somebody around me was treating me differently because of my gender. I think balancing how to be a strong, rational person with how to accept that I may be very emotional at times was challenging. I think learning how to negotiate, how am I, how do I choose to be feminine? Because the classic definition of feminine and the classic definition of engineer don't really align. And so figuring out my answer to how do I pull cards from both and create a career and a personality and a direction for myself that I value, and that I feel comes to their benefit. I think a lot of times I would be concerned if you're the only female and in the room, I would be worried that I was responsible for representing my entire gender. And so I'd be afraid of making a mistake or asking a question really for fear of what other people would think. And yeah, when you aren't comfortable asking those questions or making those mistakes, you don't learn it. And so over time I've grown into being able to take those risks and put myself out there. But that's the question of how much of that is my personality and my choices and my approach to life versus something that was actually there for me. 

So you grew into somebody who could be more, is not a afraid to speak your mind, put your thoughts into action.

And I think honestly more willing to fail, more willing to be wrong, more willing to make a mistake, more focus on what I learned from the mistake rather than that I made the mistake in the first place and that as I've grown into that, it's been one of the best things I've done as an engineer. Yeah.

Well I feel like you've had an overall positive experience. And from my side too, on the science side, I feel like I've always been surrounded by people who support me. And you know, at Brown I was predominantly, my lab was predominantly female and even my professor was a male but he was very nurturing and encouraging. And I don't know, because I had been doing research on this topic, I know that this is not common. There's a lot of statistics on how stem fields are notorious for sexual harassment or sexism and maybe, do you think we were just sheltered in a way? Is it because we were at Brown that we had a good experience? I don't know. Curious. 

Yeah. I wondered about that as well, because the statistics that I see and that I do trust don't always seem to line up with the colloquial experience of people around me. Yeah, it's really bad. You know, one of the things is, one of the things I've been reading about is that the number of female graduates with a bachelor's in computer science has actually gone down. 

Oh really?

Yeah. I don't know, over the past, like tens of decades it has gone down. I don't know if that trend has changed in very recent years. And so understanding the story of why do people choose to leave stem and why did people choose to opt out of it? I do think role models is part of that. I think at the high school and college level, many people I know have struggled with imposter syndrome, both male and female. And some subset of people really do find something else that they love a lot, and would rather do it. But yeah.

Maybe it's like, there's been people who do say that once you enter the workforce, you don't have anybody to look up to or tell you how to succeed in a male dominated environment. At least in science historically, all the people in power, all the people who have been in the past are men. 

One of the questions I have asked myself a lot is, at least in the discussions of women in stem, a lot of it is about how do we reshape ourselves to fit the conventional model of a person in stem, which is largely a male model as a person in stem. And one of the things I've really enjoyed and gained in some of the newer discussions is of changing the model itself, figuring out how to change that.

Okay.

And that's really hard, right? But I think it's a really valuable discussion to have and questions to be asking.

Yeah. I mean that really takes time and people actually putting an effort to think about these topics. And these discussions, are they primarily aimed towards women? Do only women go to these discussions?

I don't know, I can talk to both my male and female peers, but I think it's a much safer topic with my female peers. And when and how I approach this I do it more cautiously depending on the person. I have gravitated in my life to surrounded myself with friends and mentors who are female outside of the classroom. But when I'm in the classroom, those ratios totally change compared to what I've created and built for myself outside.

Yeah. Because if we don't project these questions and topics, they don't reach a wider audience. I don't see how things would change. Right. I guess this is also a general consideration for sexism and gender equality as a whole and all that.

Okay.

Okay. Let's see. We're going to skip everything work related. Oh yeah. If you could give advice to, you know, somebody aspiring to be an engineer, and following in your footsteps, is there anything that you would tell her? Any advice on how to navigate the field?

So I think one of the biggest differences for me was getting comfortable getting hands on experience. For me that was the open ended non-classroom portion of engineering that was terrifying, but also far closer to what happens after college. When I was in high school, I had the opportunity to be in a robotics lab, which I was really lucky to have an opportunity like that in high school. But this goes back to being so afraid of not already knowing things that I didn't ask questions to learn how to use CAD or how to use power tools or how to use the machines in the lab. And I ended up not taking advantage of a lot of the learning opportunities available to me. And so when I got to college, I chose to join the car team, not because I had any particular interest in cars, but because it seemed like that was where the really scrappy, creative, dedicated engineers work. And I wanted to just surround myself with people like that. And I found that I could do a lot of the things that I didn't know how to do. And the learning how to learn outside of the classroom was hugely valuable. So that experience looks different for everybody. For some people, the project come as side projects, for some people it's research, but finding whatever your thing is, follow your own path rather than completing the assignments that are given. So I think that was hugely valuable. I think the other thing I would say is to kind of find your anchors. Engineering is a very, very tough discipline at times. And having a support network around you makes you a better engineer. And to find and build that network from early on. Even now I still end up going back to people I knew from high school or college and they are still a very important part of my life and support network today. 

So do you think we need to make more of an effort to keep recruiting and engaging women in stem? I Dunno. There's a question that came up during a discussion that we had in machine learning class and I brought up like, oh, you know, I worked in a computational neuroscience lab at Princeton where I was the only girl out of 20 men in the lab. And we were trying to hire, Sebastian who was my PI was trying to make an effort to hire female postdocs and stuff, but it was really difficult, there was nobody out there.

I definitely think the pipeline problem is real. I think from the bits that I've looked at, the numbers bear out that like, starting from somewhere between middle and high school, you ended up with declining numbers of females in stem. I also feel that if all companies just say it's the pipeline problem, it's not going to get fixed, because it goes both ways. And so I think we should both be looking at what do we change in high school and college and also be looking at how do we choose to hire.


Okay. This is just a random question. Do you think treatment is different between women of color versus white women in engineering?

That's a tough one for me. One of my complaints about engineering has been that after high school engineering became very lacking in engineers of color. Which is like a separate, separate problem, but it means that I don't really have much personal experience on that topic. I halfway identify as a person of color, but I think because I am not apparently a person of color to those around me, a lot of what I perhaps could feel, I don't end up feeling. 

Oh yeah. Just wondering, how many of your professors in your courses, like your engineering courses at Brown were women?

Ooh, Bloom for the intro engineering class. And who is also my mentor. I don't think any of my CS professors were. Maybe I had one more later in engineering or math, but if so, I'm blanking on who it was now. Okay. 

Well, so not that many.

Not really.

Okay. Hmm. Sure. Do you have like anything you'd like to add? Anything to discuss?

No, I think you had really good questions. I wish I had answers to the larger problems, but it's been a struggle when I think about trying to give back. And it took me to outreach where I can reach mixed gender and engineering communities and an early age. So like middle and high school. And probably they don't notice or pay attention to the fact that I'm an engineer. But my hope is that by the time they get into college and into the workplace, they still have an environment in which many of these things are true and not have to ask the same questions we are asking.

Wait, so you're doing like a volunteering thing?

I've been volunteering at robotics competitions for the past three years now. So I do middle school through high school, and I make a point to try to volunteer in their technical roles wherever possible.

And so there, do you notice any gender gaps there or is it pretty 50/50?

Middle school is usually pretty good, especially because the programs I work with are smaller teams and so it's easier to get together an all female team of eight students. By the time you get to the larger high school teams, in particular because these are kind of hands on projects...Yeah, it's usually pretty bad already. And so I think if you can change it at that point it's a start.

Yeah, I think maybe, because my high school also had a robotics team and it just felt so...like a robot was not really anything I could imagine, it felt like it was all metal and construction, it never interested me, but it's really not just that.

I think that's what's the shame is that I think there are a lot of people who would love robotics, but kind of the rep it has and what people think of it is very different than the reality of it.

Yeah, I guess if I knew that all of this coding and building and engineering, wasn't necessarily all about clunky metal robots and electronics. Like I could make cool projects with flashing lights, generative music, all that. I would've started way earlier.

Yeah, it's not all about robots. That's for sure. 

Yeah. So maybe it's just about promoting fun, diverse projects for kids to engage in. Like here, look at all of these fun things you can do if you have these skills.

Yeah.

Okay I think we covered most of it. Pretty good.

Okay.

So I can stop recording and if you have time to talk, we can also at chat offline.
