## Sicko, Dan. Techno Rebels: The Renegades of Electronic Funk. Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, 2014.

ML3540.S532010

This book is often heralded as one of the first books to demystify the genre of techno--shrouded in confusing origins and bastardized in the modern interpretation of electronic music as "all-in-one", techno is difficult to accurately define. Though now frequently mistaken as an European export, the author brings the origin of techno to the city of Detroit, and expands from there. The book is very much centered around Detroit--covering the climate of post-industrial Detroit that gave birth to the techno sound, to the central techno DJs that grew up and created the sound, to the influence it had on Europe and beyond. 

### Subjects
* [DDC & LCC subject headings for the call number]
* Additional parent or child subject that seems relevant
* Another parent or child subject (while keeping the list ordered from least- to most-specific)
* As many additional subjects as are related…

### Questions
1. Can we map the reciprocal influences of the techno sound between Detroit/US and Europe?
2. How did the sound of techno become so synonymous to drug use in mainstream media?
3. What about Detroit gave rise to one of the most significant sounds of the club/underground scenes today? What about this music makes us 'feel'? How different is the original sound to the sounds it birthed subsequently? Can we distinguish them methodically?

## Reynolds, Simon. Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture. London: Routledge, 2016.

ML3540.R491998

This book explores the phenomenon of the 'rave culture' and its relationship with electronic music by tracing its origins, its influence on the very music it thrived on, and its validity as a culture. Starting out as a rock enthusiast, the author reviews his own personal transition from a rock critic to a electronic music critic, and his experiences within the scene. By following techno and house music from their origins to their morphing into multitudes of subgenres, he makes the point that the hub of innovation resides exactly in the fringes, or in 'hardcore' environments (whatever it may entail in that time period), which by nature allow for experimentation without inhibition.

### Subjects
LCC
* ML: Music literature
* ML 3540: Popular music

* ML 3544 - 3776: Folk, national, and ethnic music

DDC
* 780: Music
* 780.8: History and description of music with respect to kinds of persons

### Questions
1. This book stops its course in the early 2000s. What does fringe culture look like now, and how are new musical ideas being developed?
2. Fashion trends also took inspiration from rave culture. How can we map out all of the trends that have started within these movements?
3. Fringe societies are often a backlash and/or refuge from the current climate of society. What 'cultures' exist today that are similar or equivalent to the rave culture of the past?

There are many dimensions of sexual violence and harassment experienced by people of all genders. This particular book focuses on 'technology-facilitated sexual violence', specifically towards women--this concept is defined as the myriad of ways in which sexual vilence and harassment are being perpetrated with the use of digital communication technologies. The authors have compiled theories, occurences, and preventative measures of the rapidly proliferating phenomenon.

A few sentences describing the book. Try to summarize the subject it’s dealing with and what its ‘take’ on that subject is. Try reading over the table of contents first, then skimming the openings of the chapters/sections, and finally riffling through the index.

## Gross, Charles G. Brain, Vision, Memory Tales in the History of Neuroscience. MIT Press: Cambridge, Mass., 1998.

QP353.G761998

Charles Gross is a neuroscientist who specializes in brain mechanisms in vision and perception, but has a self-professed love of the history of neuroscience. Throughout his career, he has written historical essays highlighting some of the curiosities of brain science around the world. He has compiled these essays in this book to provide a rich backdrop to what we now call neuroscience. He starts with the history of how our ancestors viewed the brain, then focuses on a number of significant figures in the field of neuroscience, and then some specific areas of the brain, including the hippocampus and the striate cortex.

### Questions
1. How does the history of brain science differ in the east vs west? We predominantly hear only about the discoveries originating in western countries, but were similar experiments being done in parallel in the east?
2. What are some of the misconceptions of the brain that have been exposed to, from back in the day when people thought they thought with the heart, to modern times (fights between scientists claiming opposing theories)?
3. How will neuroscience and artificial intelligence merge in the future?
