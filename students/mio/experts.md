Sort the list so the people you’re most interested in talking to are at the top.

### Candidates

#### Cori Bargmann
Professor, Rockefeller University
Cori Bargmann is a renowned neurosciencist working in olfaction in C. Elegans. She is an HHMI investigator, and incoming president for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. She is also married to Richard Axel, nobel laureate--would be interesting to hear her perspective on being partners with such a high profile academic, while also holding her own in terms of research and prestige.

#### Sebastian Seung
Professor, Princeton University

Sebastian Seung is a professor of computer science and neuroscience at Princeton University. I worked in his lab previously, and had the experience of being the only female there in a lab of 20 men (this isn't for a lack of trying on his part to include more women). It would be interesting to hear his perspective on the lack of women in computer science, and how we could work to change that in the future.
